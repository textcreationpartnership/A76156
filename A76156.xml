         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S is the Moon with the Stars unto the expanded Firmament; As are the well ordered Cities with their Ornaments and Fortifications to the Woods and Wilderness; Such is the Church to the rest of the World. The felicity of the Church is in the Love of God, and its blessed influences, whose face is that Sun which doth enlighten and enliven it. If earth and sin had not caused a separation and ecclipse, the World and the Church would have been the same, and this Church would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an uninterrupted Day-light. It is the Earth that moveth and turneth from this Sun, and not the Suns receding from our Earth, that brings our Night. It is not God, but Man, that lost his Goodness; Nor is it necessary to our Reparation, that a change be made On him, but on us. Christ came not into the World to make God Better, but to make us Better; Nor did he Die to make him more disposed to do Good, but to Dispose us to Receive it: Though as he is extrinsecally Denominated from the particular Object, to be particularly <hi>Willing</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> and to <hi>Love</hi> that which he <hi>Loved</hi> not before; so we may well say, that Christ dyed to purchase for us the Love of God, and to procure his willingness of a present effecting our Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and so to Accept and Approve us as his own▪ But his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase was not Actually to change the mind of God, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to have Mercy, who before was dis-inclined: but to make the Pardon of mans sin a Thing convenient, for the Righteous and Holy Governour of the world to bestow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impeachment of the Honour of his Wisdom, Holiness or Justice: yea, to the more eminent Glorifying of them all.
<pb facs="tcp:118986:4"/> Two things are requisite to make man to be Amiable in the eyes of God, and a fit Object for the most Holy to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in: One is in his suitableness to the Holiness of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The other respecteth his Governing Justice. We must in this life see God in the Glass of the Creature, and specially in Man that beareth his Image. If a good man be the Ruler of a Common-wealth, as he is Ethically Good, he cannot but loath the Evil, and love the Good: And as he is a Wise and Righteous Governour, he must preserve the honor of his Laws, and thereby his own, by doing Justice on them that violate them, and preserving and encouraging those that do obey them. As man is first considerable as Man, before he be to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Governour; and as a good Man, before as a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, the first being his Natural Goodness, commonly called his universal Justice, the other his Rectoral Goodness, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called his particular Justice, flowing out from the first: so must we (through the necessity of our present weakness) conceive of God. Were we Holy, he would love us as a Holy God: and were we Innocent, he would encourage us as a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Bounteous Governour. But as there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Governing Justice, without that universal Natural Justice, which it presupposeth, and floweth from; so can there be no such thing as Innocency in us as Subjects, which floweth not from a Holiness of our Natures as Men. We must <hi>Be</hi> Good, before we can <hi>Live</hi> as the Good. In both these respects man was Amiable in the eyes of his Maker, till sin depraved him, and deprived him of Both. To <hi>Both</hi> these must the Saviour again Restore him: and this is the work that he came into the World to do, even to seek and to save that which was doubly lost, and to destroy that two-fold work of the Devil, who had drawn us to be both <hi>Unholy</hi> and <hi>Guilty.</hi> As in the Fall the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Real Evil was Antecedent to the Relative (Guilt); so is it in the Good conferred in the Reparation. We must in order of nature be first Turned by Repentance unto God, through
<pb facs="tcp:118986:4"/> Faith in the Redeemer, and then receive the Remission of our sins, <hi>Acts 26. 18. Rom.</hi> 8. 30. And as it was man himself that was the subject of that two-fold unrighteousness, so is it man himself that must be restored to that two-fold Righteousness which he lost, that is, Sanctity and Not-Guiltiness. Christ came not to possess God with any false opinion of us; nor is he such a Physitian as to perform but a supposed or Reputative Cure: He came not to perswade his Father to judge <hi>Us</hi> to be <hi>Well,</hi> because <hi>He</hi> is <hi>Well;</hi> nor to leave us uncured, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade God that we are Cured. It is We that were guilty and unholy; it is We that must be justified or condemned; and therefore it is We that must be restored unto Righteousness. If Christ only were Righteous, Christ only would be reputed and judged Righteous, and Christ only would be Happy. The Judge of the world will not justifie the unrighteous, meerly because another is Righteous: Nor can the Holy God take Complacency in an unholy sinner, because another is Holy. Never did the blessed Son of God intend in his dying or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to change the holy Nature of his Father, and to cause him to Love that which is not Lovely, or to Reconcile him to that which he Abhorreth, as he is God. We must bear his own Image, and be Holy as he is Holy, before he can Approve us, or Love us in Complacency. This is the work of our blessed Redeemer, to make Man fit for Gods Approbation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Though we are the Subjects, he is the Cause. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth us, That he may Pardon us; and pardoneth us, that he may further sanctifie us, and make us fit for our Masters use. He will not remove our Guilt till we Return; nor will he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our actual services till our Guilt be removed. By superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural operations must both be accomplished: A Regress from such a Privation as was our Unholiness, requireth a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work <hi>upon</hi> us: And a deliverance from such Guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Punishment, requireth a supernatural operation <hi>for</hi> us. The one Christ effecteth by his sanctifying Spirit, through the
<pb facs="tcp:118986:5"/> instrumentality of his Word, as <hi>Informing</hi> and <hi>Exciting:</hi> The other he effecteth by his own (and his Fathers) Will, through the instrumentality of his <hi>Gospel-Grant,</hi> by way of <hi>Donation,</hi> making an universal conditional▪ Deed of gift of himself and Remission and Right to Glory, to all that Return by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith. His Blood is the meritorious cause of both, but not of both on the same Account: For it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Guilt only that made his Blood Necessary for our Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: Had there been nothing to do but Renew us by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Sanctification, this might have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Bloodshed, by the work of the Word and Spirit: As God at first gave man his Image freely, and did not sell it for a Price of Blood: Nor doth he so Delight in Blood, as to desire it, or accept it for it self, but for the ends which it must, as a convenient means, attain. Those ends are the Demonstration proximately of his governing Justice, in the vindication of the honour of his Law and Rule, and for the awing of others: ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately and principally, it is the Demonstration of his natural sin-hating Holiness, and his unspeakable Love to the sons of men, but specially to his Elect: In this sense was Christ a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and ransome, and may truly be said to have satisfied for our sins. He was not a sinner, nor so esteemed, nor could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly take upon himself the same Numerical Guilt which lay on us (the Accident, if removed from its Subject, perisheth) nor yet a Guilt of the same <hi>sort,</hi> as having not the same sort of foundation or efficient; ours arising from the Merit of our sin, and the Commination of the Law, and <hi>His</hi> being rather <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned</hi> then <hi>Merited</hi> by our sin, and occasioned by the Laws threatening of us (both which are, as we may call them, but <hi>Pro</hi>-causes, as to him) having neither sin of his own, nor merit of wrath from such sin; nor did the Law oblige him to suffer for our sins; but he obliged himself to suffer for our sins, though not as in our Persons strictly, yet in our stead, in the person of a Mediator.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118986:5"/>
            <p>The Lord our Redeemer having thus laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by paying a sufficient ransom for all mankind, and perfectly finished his work of satisfaction, he taketh a longer time for the conveyance of the fruits of it. As the Expiatory sacrifice was for All, so will he have the tenour of his Grant in the Gospel to be Universal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint to any, or excepting any: All shall have Pardon and Right to life Eternal, if they will Believe and Repent, and none shall have them that Refuse these Conditions: Antecedently to Believing; All have an equal Conditional Gift of pardon, and None have an Absolute, nor an Actual Right: The Gospel findeth us equal, and makes no inequality, till we first make it our selves: But the secret unsearchable workings of Divine Grace do begin the difference, and make it <hi>in</hi> us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is made <hi>by</hi> us. As an Eternal Purpose did Design it, so an insuperable Victorious hand doth execute it: When the same Christ hath dyed for All, and the same Conditional Grant is made to All, and the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of it is made to many, even to All that hear it; Yet the same Victorious Internal Grace is not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to All; nor doth God give All a Heart to Believe and Accept of what the Promise offereth them. The Spirit is as the wind, that bloweth where it listeth. All have sufficient Objective Grace, that live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; and all have a sufficient Help External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to make them Better, and bring them Neerer to Christ than they <hi>were:</hi> But All have not <hi>sufficient</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace Immediately to cause them to <hi>Believe:</hi> much less <hi>Effectual.</hi> That this is denyed to <hi>any,</hi> is long of themselves, who abuse that Commoner Grace which was sufficient to have made them <hi>Better:</hi> That it is Granted to <hi>Any,</hi> is from the Bounty of God: That it is Granted to <hi>This</hi> man rather then to <hi>That,</hi> is from his Absolute
<pb facs="tcp:118986:6"/> Dominion, and Will, and his Differencing Grace. We do not only All deserve Death, by Original sin, but we did All Deserve to be Denyed the Grace of Christ, by a following Demerit: And All that want the Gospel, or the special efficacy of it in Regeneration, do by sin against some Common Grace, Deserve that <hi>want:</hi> (We still suppose Infants Involved in their Parents case) so that God will Judge none on the meer terms of the rigid Law of Nature, nor Condemn them only for Original sin. They that say otherwise, do too injuriously exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate both the Grace of God, and the sin of man. If All have some Grace shewed them (that is, some Mercy contrary to their Merit) then all have some sin against Grace: and then All shall be Judged by the Procurer of that Grace, for their sin against it. It is not the least wrong that the Pelagians, Jesuites and Arminians have done to the Church, that by making Grace Universal further than was just, they have tempted others in way of Opposition to deny that Grace of God which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Universal, or which is Common to more than the Elect alone: and by making Christ to have dyed for All with an equal Intention of saving them, they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned so many to deny that indeed he did dye for All: So that had not the Notions of an Universal sufficiency of Christs Death, and of an Universal Offer of him in the Gospel, through the Great Mercy of God been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served among us, and these had much Influence into our Popular and Practical Preaching, we had been drawn very neer to a subverting of the very foundation, and should have been too like to them that preach <hi>another Gospel,</hi> to the great danger of the souls of our hearers, and the dishonour of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>The two great works of Christ in the Application or Collation of the Benefits which he hath Merited, are
<pb facs="tcp:118986:6"/> those before mentioned: Justification, and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: under the first I contain Remission, Acceptance, Absolution, and Imply Adoption, and our Right to Glory. Under the latter I comprehend, the Giving of the Spirit, and all its Purifying Works upon our souls.</p>
            <p>I think it had been well for the Church, if we had used less in our Disputes the term <hi>Justification,</hi> or had differenced better between the Name and the Thing, and discerned about which it was that we contended: and when we once saw that there was no Hope of agreeing about the sense of that word, if we had treated more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly about Remission of sin alone, and under that term, and tryed how we could have agreed upon that: Could we yet be so discreet, I think the Church would reap much benefit by it. Doubtless we might much easier convince a Papist, who will allow us so much of that which we demand about Remission of sin, while they contend against us in the point of Justification: when so many of ours do take Remission and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the same thing.</p>
            <p>It pleaseth our Physitian in a sweet equality to carry on both these happy Works, Remission and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to let one go so far before the other, as those think, who suppose our sins to be pardoned before they are sins, or that our Pardon is absolutely perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Death. As we shall have more sins to remove by further Sanctification, so shall we have more still to pardon, to the last: and one of these works as well as the other, will be imperfect, till we are perfected. And they that take Pardon and Justification for the same, or the former to be any part of the latter, must then confess that Justification is no more perfect than Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118986:7"/>
            <p>They are very different Questions, How we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted just, or put into a Justifyed state at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version? and how we are sentenced just, or justifyed at Gods Judgement Seat? They that will needs (to the great disgrace of their understandings) deny that there is any such thing as a justification at Judgement, must either say that there is no Judgement, or that All are Condemned; or that judging doth not contain Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Condemnation, as its disjunct species; but some men shall then be judged, who shall neither be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed or condemned. To which end, when they have first taken down the Authority of Christ, who tells us that <hi>By our words we shall (then) be justifyed, or by our words we shall be condemned,</hi> they must next take down the Authority of Lawyers, and then, of our common custom of speech, and must set up their own Authority instead of all. To say, God will then but declare us just, is no answer, till they have proved that it is not by a sentence of judgement that he will declare it; or else, that declaring by a sentence of judgement, is no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; yea, that it is not the most proper and full ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification imaginable.</p>
            <p>I have said enough in the following Treatise, to shew my thoughts of the Necessity and Excellency of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sincere obedience. We are taught to pray for it in the Lords Prayer, (in the three first Petitions) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the forgiveness of sin (in the fifth) And doubtless it is that higher Blessing, which forgiveness tendeth to, as a means to the end: Even that God may have his own again, which was lost, and man may again be neerer and liker to God, and fitter to know, love and honour him, and be happy therein. I scarce know any one error that hath subjected the Church and Christian Religion so much to the jealousies and reproach of unbelievers, or
<pb facs="tcp:118986:7"/> the Reformed Churches to the scorn of the Papists, and so hardened them in their way, as some mens misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and misreporting the doctrine of the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Righteousness to a sinner. But especially by those men, who affirm that we are justified even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we repent or believe, and that through the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Righteousness, God judgeth the most swinish impenitent wretch, (so he be elect) to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his sight, and the object of his complacency. As if a man should fall in love with a Toad, upon a false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that it is a Lark. Christs Righteousness is ours for the pardon of our sin, and the merit of Grace and Glory for us: but not to be instead of Faith, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Sanctification or sincere Obedience. He that hath not these, shall never be saved by Christs Righteousness. So far as we are sinners, a Pardon is our Righteousness: but so far as we are holy, it is not so: And he that hath not somewhat better then sin in him, is none of Christs.</p>
            <p>As the very constitution of Faith and Repentance to be conditions of pardon, and sincere Obedience to be a condition of Salvation, hath plainly excepted final in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and impenitency, and Rebellion, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those sins that shall be pardoned, and we shall be justified from; so must their contraries be found in us at Judgement, if we will be then justified. And then, as the Blood and Merits of Christ (or as commonly its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his imputed Righteousness) must be the matter of our justification from the guilt of all other sins (that is, from the guilt of all sin, which believers did commit) so must our own personal Faith, Repentance, and sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be the matter of our Justification from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular false Accusation, (potential or actual) of final non-performance of these conditions of the Gospel, and
<pb facs="tcp:118986:8"/> of our having no part in Christ and Life, for want of those conditions. This is the Justification by works (as many are willing to call it, to make it odious) which I do assert and defend, and which I judge so necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that I shall endeavour to acquaint those with it whom I must Catechise.</p>
            <p>The summe of what I have said is this; That Mans perfection and felicity is finally in God; and that his Recovery consisteth in being brought b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck to him, which must be done, as by the Merits of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ist, so by Union with him, and consequently by communication of Life from him: And having union with Christ▪ it necessarily followeth that we have union with the Church, which is his Body, and communion with it. Were we not One among our selves, we were not <hi>A Body:</hi> and were we not One in Christ our center and Head, we wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not <hi>His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> As we have internal communion in the same Spirit, in the same Faith, Hope, and Love; so have we external communion in the same Profession of Faith and Piety (in the essentials) and in the same Practise of Worshiping God through our Lord Iesus Christ, and in sincerely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting each other for our Salvation.</p>
            <p>There is therefore as One only Head and Lord, so one Only Body and Catholike Church, and one only true Religion in the world, and that is the Christian Religion: All that hold the Essentials of this Religion sincerely, are of the true Church, and of the true Religion, and all of One Religion, how different soever in lesser things. Though they may each appropriate Christ and the Church, and the true Religion to themselves, and censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously exclude all others (as do the Papists) yet are their censured Brethren nevertheless Christians, and of the true Church and Religion for all their censures. Every Child is not a Bastard, nor disinherited, nor cast out of
<pb facs="tcp:118986:8"/> the Family, whom an angry brother shall call Bastard in their fallings out. The relative union holds, even when local conjunction and communion in actual worship, and in the profession of lower Truths is disclaimed. Yea, if a froward Christian say, <hi>I am not of the same Church or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as you,</hi> yet is he not the less of the same (if the other be a Christian): nor doth that break him off, seeing he intendeth not to disclaim Christians as Christians, but as Erroneous. Yet such dislocations, and breaches, and divisions, are the great rejoycing of the enemy of the Church, and the great dishonour of our sacred professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tendeth to the great hurt and ruin of the dividers; and hath ever been an exceeding hinderance of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>AS it is thus the great design of Christ, by Unity and Purity to bring his Church to perfect felicity, in the full enjoyment of the ever blessed God; so is it the design and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aily business of Satan to counter-work him, and to keep men from felicity in God, by keeping them from Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, from Unity, and from Purity.</p>
            <p>His first work is to disgrace the Christian Faith, and to tell men how improbable it is to be true; and to that end to hide the Evidence from their eyes. If he cannot thus totally keep them from Christ, he usually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth them to take up with a bare opinionative assent; and putteth before them the Idols of Pleasure, Profits, and Vain-glory, that they may by a seeming felicity be detained from God.</p>
            <p>And as knowing how much the Churches welfare, and the saving of souls, dependeth upon the Teachers and Leaders of the Flocks, his chiefest endeavors are for
<pb facs="tcp:118986:9"/> the perverting of them; that they may become his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the perverting of the rest.</p>
            <p>For Magistrates, he would first taint them with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret infidelity; or else engage them to the utmost in a carnal self-interest, and perswade them that Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest doth stand in their way. He would delude them so far as to cause them to mistake where their interest lyeth, and so to espouse them to an interest inconsistent with Christs; and then will they be involved before they are aware into a seeming necessity of fighting against Heaven, and secret or open opposition of the Church: The deceiver would make them forget, that <hi>from Christ</hi> they have their power, and <hi>under him</hi> and <hi>for him</hi> must they hold it, and exercise it. A fairer opportunity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hath to draw the Princes and Great ones of the world, to forget that they are but men, and servants, and to forget the fading vanity and danger of their condition, and to Rebel against Christ by self exaltation, then with the meaner and poorer inhabitants of the earth: He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them a more golden and glorious bait, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath hitherto befooled the most of them, to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that stone that will dash them in pieces. Or else if he cannot taint them with the common Profaness, he will at least engage them to a hatred of the power of Godliness. Or if he can taint them (as he did <hi>Constantius</hi>) with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, he will engage them to fall upon the soundest in the Church▪ Or can he but delude them to sit by, and as Neuters to look on, as being indifferent between Christ and him, at least, he will deprive the Church of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their power, or of that special interest in them, which they may claim from their commission. As <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> calls the Magistrate the Vice-gerent of Christ; so may the Church justly say as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did, <hi>Apologet. cap. 33. Imper atorem necesse est ut suspiciamus, ut eum quem
<pb facs="tcp:118986:9"/> Dominus Noster elegit: ut merito dixerim, Noster est magis Caesar, ut à Nostro Deo Constitutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the main design of the enemy is against their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
            <p>Some of them he keeps in a superficial, carnal and customary Christianity; So that they never soundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the great mysteries which (for a Living) they study and preach: And how such are like to edifie the Church, and preach that heartily to others, that never was in their own hearts, you may easily Judge: when they must speak all out of their books, and by hear-say, and the common opinion of others, of things which they never well believed or felt themselves.</p>
            <p>Others he intangleth in worldly affairs, and causeth them to mind the matters of the flesh, that they are heartless and unfaithful in their masters work; So that poor souls may go to Hell with very little disturbance, and starve even at the next door to them, while they are minding their Own matters, or are dulled by lazyness, and addict their chiefest affections and endeavours to the service of so vile a master as their flesh.</p>
            <p>How far Satan hath prevailed this way, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Congregations, is a matter of too clear Evidence, and very sad▪ consideration. As they do most grosly miscarry among the Papists, and more defiled parts of the Church, by keeping up Ignorance, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and a Carnal, Pompous, Ceremonious worship, that they may uphold a carnal Interest of their own; So I would in the most Reformed Churches we were more Innocent then we are. What an ignorant, or negligent ministery was (for the greater part) in <hi>England,</hi> in the time of the late Bishops rule, yea what opposers of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness, and too many of them openly deboist, I need not tell any that will believe their eyes and ears. And,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:10"/> though through the great mercy of God, the case is much altered in those respects, yet alas, how few are they even of those that we hope are Godly, who earnestly thirst after the saving of mens souls, and lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves freely in publike and private, in faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to that end? What a multitude of sleepy, heartless Preachers are there, that give not the Alarum of Gods approaching Iudgement to the drowsie souls that daily sit under them, nor speak to poor people with any such seriousness, as beseems them in a matter of such unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consequence. How seldom in many places shall we hear an awakening heart-warming Sermon? And of those few that are serious and diligent, so few have ability to put their matter into any handsom dress, and so many run out into intemperance and divisions, that it harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the drowsie Preachers the more in their way; and they take their dulness for soberness, and their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do the less check them for their neglect of mens souls. This is the unhappy case of many men of Good learning and parts: They are so sensible of the evil of the exorbitancies of the times, that they overlook and regard not the evil of their own heartless and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Administration. If they hear a Private man use some unfit expressions in prayer, it extreamly offendeth them: but if they totally omit it, they are not much offended at it. They forget that God will bear more with many slips of the tongue, and unhandsom words, then with a neglect of his worship, or a heartless performance of it: and that their well-drest forms, if lifeless, are stinking carkasses, or useless pictures, when a broken heart, with broken expressions may go away with the blessing. And therefore they are commonly against private mens pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, especially before many; And as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists would drive them from the Scripture for fear of
<pb facs="tcp:118986:10"/> abusing it, so would they drive them from such Prayer, lest they should hap to use some unhansome words.</p>
            <p>Were there no other charge against the pious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>England,</hi> but only the common neglect of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, I think we should be ashamed to look up to heaven. Because the Sword doth not enforce it, they think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done; such contemptuous thoughts have they of their own offices, and the spiritual Sword which Christ hath put into their hands. Because there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about some Modes and Accidents of Discipline, therefore will they neglect the substance, which most are agreed in. Some will examine mens fitness for the Sacrament, and think they have done all, if they keep the unworthy from that Ordinance; suffering them still to remain members, and enjoy other parts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. If Ruling be as Essential a part of our Pastoral work as Preaching, then are those to be numbred among Negligent Ministers, that neglect to Rule, as well as those that neglect to Preach. And why the Magistrate should not Punish <hi>such negligent</hi> ones, as well as the other, I yet know not.</p>
            <p>But the great advantage that Satan hath got upon the Church, through the sin of the Pastors in these latter times, is by Division: For by this he hath much promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the rest of his Designs. Infidelity it self breaks in upon us; and not only the vulgar, but many of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer forwardness and parts, do question or cast off all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, because they see us of so many minds and wayes. And our sin hath as haynous Aggravations as most mens can have: In that <hi>We</hi> are the men that have seen the sad effects of Division, that have had such extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to heal them; such Calls, such opportunities and advantages for a closure, and so long time in all: We have lived to see the Church in danger of being swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb facs="tcp:118986:11"/> up by deceit and by violence; and yet as we have laid it open to all this danger by our divisions or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, so we do sit still and do little to rescue it from the danger.</p>
            <p>Some are regardless of these matters: some only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as of a matter of news, what others do in it, and wish it were done, while they sit still: some cry out of the Magistrate for not doing his part, not considering how they condemn themselves for neglecting their own. Few are able to do what our necessity requireth; and not many willing: Few have a skill in narrowing a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; in finding out the true point and state of it, and hitting on the right remedy: And fewer know their own inability; and therefore we do not only want Healers, but we want men of so much meekness, and self-denial, and Christian humility, as to give their consent, that others may do that, which they cannot do themselves: And well were it if they would not reject what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, meerly because it is not of their doing or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, or because it comes not from those whom they esteem. Too many there are also, that are so apparently carnal, that they will do nothing till they know whether it be pleasing to those in Power, lest they should make an ill bargain in hazarding their outward welfare, and in displeasing men that can hurt them, to please Christ, who they presume will not hurt them. And yet more are there, that apprehending how much the exercise of Christian Discipline displeaseth the vulgar, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will lose them their love and maintenance, will rather quietly let all alone, then unite with any in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull a work.</p>
            <p>And yet more hainous is our sin in the continuance of these divisions, in that we have been too much guilty of
<pb facs="tcp:118986:11"/> being the Leaders into it, and therefore should lead out of it; and in that it especially belongeth to our office; and in that we have yet some such interest in our peoples estimation that we may probably do somewhat toward it. But specially, because the remedy is so obvious, and our union so easie, were we but truly willing and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to attain it. 1. For Discipline, our differences lie in so narrow a room, that there is no probability of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a breach, if we had but got together, and humbly and lovingly followed on the work, in impartial consultations, and in seeking Gods direction. 2. And for Doctrine, we have a Test and Rule sufficient to unite in: we have the whole sacred Scripture, which if we all profess to believe, we surely make a full profession of Faith. Or if that be too large, we have the Apostles Creed, or other ancient Creeds of the Church; and the Scripture before us, sufficient to afford us both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words for a full and fit Confession of our Faith.</p>
            <p>But the Deceiver hath here over-reacht us as much as in any thing. Some are such Infidels and indifferent to all Religions, that they would have no Test at all, but have all to live in a broken Licentiousness: But I hope amongst Ministers these are but few. The far greater number run into the contrary extream, and would have almost all that thrust on others which they are confident of themselves: (And confidence is not the best or commonest sign of Truth.) Hence are our large and disputable confessions, to be imposed on others: Hence is it that every man is so ready to lay the heaviest charges on those that differ from his own conceits. That is hainous error which crosseth our opinions, and where we err not for company: and we are willing the Magistrate should restrain men from contradicting us, as being secretly conscious of our own
<pb facs="tcp:118986:12"/> disability, to make good the cause that we are so confident is the right.</p>
            <p>All this must be done under some pious pretence: It is in a blinde zeal for unity that the Papists destroy (as much as in them lyeth) the Unity of the Church: It is in a blinde zeal against error that many an error is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The most destructive engine (for ought I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that ever was used to divide that Church, were Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, superfluous, and questionable Rules, in imposed Confessions, intended by proud and ignorant men, for the Unity of that Church, and the security of the Truth.</p>
            <p>THese being the apparent ways of the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by Christ, and its danger from the Deceiver, which are before mentioned; I have judged it my duty to promote as much as I could, Christs means for our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and to oppose as much as I could the Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and endeavors for our ruine. And in my weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances my encouragements have been such from God and man, that I have no cause to complain, or to be much discouraged by some smaller Opposition. I must needs confess that I did not, nor could in modesty expect the tenth part of that acceptance and fruit of my poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, as upon experience I have since found. And when I meet with opposition, my conscience constraineth me to suspect my own miscarriage, and first to enquire, how far I have given cause. But when I have made as imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al an enquiry as I am able, and am more confirmed in the Truth which I have owned, I dare not desert that Truth under pretence of humility. Nor dare I bely my self to humour other men.</p>
            <p>The Objections that I have heard made against me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb facs="tcp:118986:12"/> what in this Book I have answered already, I shall here briefly touch upon, and give some part of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in the words of others that can better bear off the blow, because mine own are so lyable to misconstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have by these dissatisfied Brethren been so much wrested as they have oft been.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some have given out that I am addicted to singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and affect to hear an <hi>Egoprimus inveni.</hi> Their proof for ought that ever I could learn, is only from my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, because I say not in all things as they do.</p>
            <p>To these Brethren I say 1. I shall promise by the grace of God to watch my heart with what diligence I can, against the affectation of singularity, and I desire their prayers and admonitions for my furtherance. 2. And I would have them also search, lest they prove guilty of a slander, while they enter into mens hearts, and venture to proclaim what they do not know. Is this the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement they give to Truth, that no man can tell them one word more then they have considered (though he profess himself never so much below them in other things) but it must be rejected as Novelty, and himself charged with singularity? Are they sure that I may not have better ends then they imagine? 3. And I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the small reputation of my reading, to make good, that the Opinions which I oppose are most, if not every one of them, notorious Novelties, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Ancient Christians for many hundred years after Christ. I profess to esteem it an unchristian thing to hunt after same and vain-glory, much more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it by the sale of Truth; and such courses can bring nothing but Infamy in the end. The great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing Characters which <hi>Tertullian</hi> giveth between an Infidel and a Christian, have taken much with me, and seemed to me excellently accommodated to each, <hi>Apol.
<pb facs="tcp:118986:13"/> cap. 46. Quid adeo simile Philosophus &amp; Christianus? Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae Discipulus &amp; Coeli? Famae Negotiator, &amp; vitae? Verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; factorum operator?</hi> To Trade for life eternal, is not consistent with Trading principally for Fame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is objected, that surely I am Proud, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, that I contradict so many others, and speak so slightly of others as I do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I say to this as to the former: I will by Gods help search my heart for the sin of Pride, and desire them to do the like, and see that they be well acquit from usurping Gods prerogative, and slandering their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this I dare say, that the evidentest victory that I have had against any sin (except Covetousness) is against Pride; and if I have not conquered this, I have conquered none: And yet I feel such reliques of it, that I am forced to suspect it, and constantly watch against it in all my undertakings. 2. But how come I to be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, that only those that know me not, load me with this charge, and never any one Brother did tell me of it to my face? 3. It may be worth their labour to search, how much Pride may lie in their impatiency of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and making a man an offender for a word, and being such that a man knows not how to speak to them, for fear of seeming contumelious, by withdrawing, or not giving them the honour they expect. I remember how <hi>Austin</hi> excused his friend to a man of such a spirit, and with a fear lest after his greatest caution he should seem contumelious himself by the Apologie, <hi>Epist. 143. ad Proculeianum.

            <p n="2">2. I resolve by Gods help never to own or subscribe to one word of error for Peace: (&amp; therefore desire much Caution in Imposed Confessions): But I am resolved to <hi>silence</hi> any Truth for the Churches Peace, which is not of greater moment and worth than its Peace, so to be obtained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I never yet was Conscious of such a Guilt, of breaking the Churches Peace by the divulging my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, (except in humane frailties, in the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them): I never endeavour to make a partie for my opinions.

               </gap>h them. The Churches were lamentably divided about such things, before that I did offer my thoughts for a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Am not I then dealt with, as if I went to part two that are fighting in the street? and though I speak them fair, and perswade them to be friends, they take witness that its I that break the Peace?</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not the peace of one divided party or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that is the Peace of Christs Church: Nor doth it beseem any Christian to have so narrow a Spirit, and to overlook Christs Interest in the rest of the Churches: but to remember the Condition of their Brethren abroad.</p>

Either their writings were contemptible, or of considerable weight; should I say the first, it would be justly taken ill: If the latter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they prove me erroneous, or not. If they do, let the equal considerer of both discern it: he may best judge that hears both speak: Blame me not then for Replying, (but for erring in my Reply; and shew me the error. If they do not convince me of error, should I silently suffer the Reputation of man to cloud the Truth, and wrong the Church, and draw people into mistakes? And is it not marvel that this Objection should seem of force against me, for my Defence, &amp; not against them that begin by an Accusation? Do we use to hear men called into question at any publike Bar, and then blamed and reviled, for appearing, or for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:118986:15"/> their Defence? But this proceeds from the respect of persons; which blindeth the wise, and perverteth Justice.</p>
            <p>Thence it is, that I am blamed by many Friends for Replying to my Reverend Brother Master <hi>Blake,</hi> who yet tell me that for all the rest its no matter, they deserved no better: When I used more reverence and care to avoid offensive words to him, then any another. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith thus to <hi>Augustine (Hieron.

Another accusation is, that I am solicitous after a union with such as are not to be united with; and to that end do bend the Truth to such a shape as may seem least offensive to them; which compliance or syncretism affected with such men, doth argue some secret inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their opinions, more then I yet manifest.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:118986:16"/> that give this out. I have spoke to this in my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Confession, and add with <hi>Tertul. Apol. c. 20. Nemo jam infamiam incutiat, nemo aliud existimet, quia nec fas est ulli de sua Religione mentiri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I affect no union with any that are not united to Christ, or appear so to me, by being in union with his Church: I will incorporate with none that deny any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental essential point of Christianity: And for the rest, I close not with them in their errors, but in the true faith which they profess. And those that be unfitted for actual Communion, though I communicate not with them, yet do I take it to be my duty to do my best to make them fit. I will not close with a Papist, as a Papist; but if I meet with a Christian that goeth under that name, I will own him as a Christian, though not as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist; and I would endeavor to undeceive him that I might fullyer joyn with him: And to that end I would take out of the way some hurtfull stumbling blocks, that I finde there laid. If he be cursed that putteth a stumbling block before the blind, I doubt he is too guilty that is angry with him that would remove it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In ever affected a Union on unlawfull terms (so far as I could discern them;) Never did I motion that we might renounce the least part of Gods Truth for unity with any: but only that we might finde out the true point of difference, and remove our verbal quarrels out of the way, and then consider, whether our disagreements are such as will warrant a rejection, separation, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of each other, or not; and accordingly to close, or alienate. In our Agreement about Discipline, some are offended that we affected any agreement with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Divines: and most of them, as averse from it, and undisposed to close with others; As if indeed we were not all Brethren; and might not well be agreed, were we
<pb facs="tcp:118986:16"/> truly and conscionably willing: For my part, I see no greater difficulty in the business.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The forwardness that is in many men to keep open divisions, and to think those that say not as they, to be so great Hereticks or so erroneous, that we must affect no communion with them, and thus making such grounds of their own for Church Union, which will not bear it, is a downright mark of a Schismatical Spirit, how earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever they may speak against Schism. There will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a sound Closure and Union but on Christs Ground-work, and in him as the Center. The Papists are the greatest Schismaticks in the world (that I know of) and yet they are the greatest pretenders to Unity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryers of Schism, and all by making a new Center for Unity: which who so doth not close in, must be disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as Schismatical; that is, by making new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, and a new Head to the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And do not some enemies of Popery, turn so far to Popery, in appropriating the Church to their own party, and making their opinions (which the Church never owned, at least for four hundred years) to be the ground of Unity, and Test of true Christians!</p>
            <p n="5">5. I never thought that when ever men differ, it is my duty to go in a middle between both (for so that middle will be next taken for an extream, and men must seek out another middle to avoid that:) but yet I have observed not only that in most differences, men can hardly keep out of extreams, and that Truth and Peace do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly befriend each other: but also that <hi>Anstins</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very probable, in <hi>Epist. 204. Donato:</hi> perswading him to return from Schism to the Church, <hi>Ibi est veritas &amp; pietas▪ quia ibi est Christiana unitas &amp; Sancti Spiritus Charitas.</hi> However I am certain that our torn condition is not so desirable to any sensible well-tempered Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:17"/> as that it should seem to him an evil to attempt to heal us. Its sad to me to see it with us, as <hi>Augustine</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time complained, <hi>Epist. 147. Mariti &amp; uxores de suo Lecto sibi consentiunt: &amp; de Christi altari dissentiunt: Filii cum perentibus unam domum habent suam; &amp; domum Dei non habent unam. Succedere in eorum haereditatem cupiunt, cum quibus de Christi heriditate rixantur. Servi &amp; Domini Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem Deum dividunt, qui formam servi accepit ut omnes serviendo liberaret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, it is my daily desire, and prayer to God, <hi>That those men who hate so narrow a Creed, and so large a Church, and think so contemptuously of men, for some fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Doctrine or Practice, may not by a sad eruption of open Infidelity among us (and that by means of such as were strict professors) be forced to set a higher value on those whom they now contemn:</hi> I must say as <hi>Greg. Nazianz. Orat. 26. pag. 458. Tu viam minime tritam &amp; inaccessam ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris: ego tritam atque calcatam, &amp; qua multi ad salutem pervenerunt. Nihil fide nostra, fratres, iniquius fingi posset si in eruditos tantum dicendique facultate, ac Logicis demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strationibus excellentes caderet; popularis autem multitudo, ut auro &amp; argento, aliisque omnibus rebus, quae hic in pretio habentur, atque a plerisque avidissime expetuntur, sic hac quoque frustraretur, ac Deus id quod altum &amp; excelsum est atque ad paucos pertingit, gratum acceptumque haberet; contra, quod propinquius est, nec vulgi captum superat, aspernaretur &amp; rejiceret.</hi> Vide reliq.</p>
            <p>Yet I must confess that the Brethren whom I now blame have one extenuation (though not sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse) for their sin; so many and desperate errors have of late risen up, that it is no wonder, if they be raised to too much jealousie, and be too ready to charge error upon all that speak any thing which they do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. Saith <hi>Erasmus in vita Hieronymi. Nullum fuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

            <p>1. The seventh and great Objection is, that I ascribe too much to mans works. To which having answered through the main body of this Book, I shall now only say, 1. That I suppose if I differ from the commonest<note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He that is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Faith as an instrument, is justified by it as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or act; for <hi>Actio est Instrumenti causalitas.</hi> I dare not go so high for all the new Arguments that I see produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for it. 2. I see many well meaning zealous men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding our Religion, and running into two desperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. One sort by the heat of opposition to Popery, do seem to have forgotten, that Faith and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, are but Means, and a way for the revolting soul to come home to God by; and thereupon place all the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their Religion in bare Believing, so making that the Whole, which is but the Door or Means to Better, even to a conformity of the soul to the image and will of God.</p>
            <p>Others observing this error, flie so far from it as to make Faith it self and Christ to be scarce necessary: so a man have but Gods image, say they, upon his soul, what
<pb facs="tcp:118986:18"/> matter is it, which way he comes by it? whether by Christ or by other means! And so they take all the History of Christ to be a meer Accident to our necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry belief; and the precepts only of Holyness to be of Absolute Necessity.</p>
            <p>The former contemn God, under pretence of extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ. The latter contemn Christ, under pretence of extolling God alone. For the object is apprehended only by the act: he therefore that contemneth the act, doth contemn the object, <hi>as</hi> an object. And so he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to extol Christ or Faith, degradeth Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thereby so far rejecteth God: And he that on pretence of extolling Godlyness, degrradeth Faith, so far rejecteth Christ its object, which makes me think of a Passage of <hi>Greg. Nazianz. Orat.</hi> 1. pa. 16. where shewing how by abusing the Doctrine of the Trinity some were become Atheists (that is, denyed consequently any God-head) and some Jews (as <hi>Arrius</hi>) he addeth a third sort that in a mistaking way of avoiding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being <hi>nimis Orthodoxi,</hi> too Orthodox, did worship many Gods in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>On the one side, Christ were not Christ, the Saviour of souls, if he should not by Faith, bring them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness, and save them from their sins.</p>
            <p>On the other side, it is a false supposition that any but Christ is able to renew Gods Image on the soul. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is only Christ that by his blood hath removed Impediments, and purchased this Power, not into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand, but into his own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Christ only that by office is appointed thereunto:</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is Christ only that hath given sufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Directions, and Rules for Sanctification.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And he only that hath propounded a sufficient Encouragement and Motive in the Promises of another Life.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:118986:18"/>5. And it is he only that can send forth a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, to sanctifie and bring back the souls of men to God. It is only to him that God hath committed the Spirit thus to bestow.</p>
            <p>I do therefore detest both these extreams. But yet it being the former that I take to be the greater, and that too many men of better repute do give too much countenanc to, in their inconsiderate disputes against Works in Justification, I thought I had a Call to speak in so great a Cause.</p>
            <p>My opinion is that its Essential to Justifying Faith to take Christ as Lord and Saviour; and that they who say, <hi>But not</hi> qua <hi>Justifying,</hi> do emply false Doctrine▪ as I have elsewhere discovered: I think that Holyness is of the Essence of Christanity; and if I were sure a man were unholy, I would not call him (except analogically) a Christian. <hi>Tertul.

            <p>The Affections of man do shew his Nature and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: what a man Loveth, such he is. God is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore Loveth Holyness: The Righteous Lord loveth Righteousness. Did God care as little what we are in our selves, as some Imagine, &amp; could love with Complacency the unholy, Impenitent, Rebellious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, upon supposition that Christ is Righteous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him, he were not what he hath told us he is in his Word. To deny God to be Holy, is to deny him to be God. And he that once believeth he hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy God, or a God so indifferent to the Holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, no wonder if he be unholy himself. For all will affect to be like their God; At least none sure will think it necessary to be better then God. No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Heathens lived wickedly, who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped wicked livers as their Gods.</p>
            <p>It is a Cutting passage of <hi>Augustine, Epist. 202. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clario,</hi> telling out of <hi>Terence</hi> of the young man that was incited to lechery, by seeing the picture of <hi>Jupiter</hi> on the wall, committing adultery; he adds, that if he had chosen rather to imitate <hi>Cato</hi> than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he had never been so tempted: <hi>Sed quo pacto id faceret cum in Templis adorare cogeretur Jovem potius quam Catonem.</hi> They that feign God so indifferent to Holyness, which his people excell in, do either make holyness a defect, and none of Gods Image, or else they make man to be better then God; and Consequently to be Gods: For he that is <hi>Best</hi> is God.</p>
            <p>I must therefore be excused, if I make not such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between Faith and Holyness, as some do (And
<pb facs="tcp:118986:19"/> yet a difference I make); and yet suppose that I am so far from dishonouring free Grace hereby, that I should but deny and reproach it, if I did otherwise. For its greater Grace to give Justification and Sanctification, then to give one alone. <hi>August. Epist. 3.

            <p>The occasion of this writing (as I have shewed in the beginning of it) was a strange Volumn of Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> seconded by Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> ushered in by Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and modestly commended to the Publike view by Mr. <hi>Caryl:</hi> This writer did by an Epistle to the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> invite them to such dealing, as he had given them an Example of. Seeing he hath led me that way, I am willing that They should have the Hearing and true knowledge of the cause. Though I then hated keen Censures and Divisions in the Societies that I affected, yet I must confess the time was when I had too Narrow thoughts of the Church of Christ, and little minded the Peace of any but of that Partie in it which I most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; and thus was involved in the guilt of Faction for want of such Catholike Considerations and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as beseem a Member of the Catholike Church. Then was I loved and esteemed by my Brethren, and met with none of their Censures or Calumnies; For though I did not wholly put mine eyes and ears into their keeping, having still an unsatisfied thirst after Truth, yet they were the Persons whom I trusted and subscribed to. But since I have seen and disclosed the Evil of a Private Spirit, and of dividing principles, and extreams in▪ Doctrine and Practise, I find the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Spirit which I oppose. Christ came not to bring me peace, when he shewed me his Truth. Since I grew into so high an esteem of Unity, some would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain me to be a man of Contention: and since I so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued Peace as to be even fond on it, it seems to draw back.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118986:20"/>
            <p>Me thinks I could better bear almost any other cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or opposition, then to be taken for a Divider or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturber of that Peace which I so earnestly affect. But as <hi>Seneca</hi> makes it the greatest tryal of a Good man, when he can <hi>Boni viri famam perdere,</hi> for the love of goodness; so I look on it as my Tryal, whether I can lose the fame of being Peaceable, for a love to Peace. Upon enquiry into the cause of this offence, me thinks I have found some in my self, and some in my Brethren. In my self I find 1. That my knowledge being very defective, the imperfections of it will appear in all that I do. But I thought that this would not have offended them that were not offended with me when I knew less: (excuse me that I say, I know more then I did: men that see, are apt to be confident of it, when they cannot well demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it to another.) 2. I find that there are some in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous passages in my <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> not fitted to their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that come to suck poyson, and to seek for a Word to be matter of Accusation, and food for their censuring Opinionative zeal. I supposed this would have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned also, when the occasion was known, and when I compared my careless style with a multitude of approved Writers. Among others, I thought I discerned these Reasons of the offence. 1. There are so many contrary Parties in the Church, that it is impossible to please all: He therefore that will please, must choose his Party, and resolve to displease all save them, and not extend his ambition too far. 2. He that will please, must have no Adversary. But if there be but one man found that hath malice enough to Accuse, there will many be found to receive his false reports. 3. My Judgement hath led me on to those Doctrines which exasperate not only single persons, but Parties, especially the Antinomians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists and Separatists: And there are some men who
<pb facs="tcp:118986:21"/> are half of their mind, that keep up some good reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Orthodox; and so standing in Judgement and Interest between both, are the readyer to receive, and the more capable to hand up the Jealousies of the rest. 4. Local distance doth much disadvantage me: it being only those that know me not, or live not within the reach of my converse that seem offended: and so I have not opportunity to give them that satisfaction, and mollifie their minds, as I doubt not but I should do, if I lived among them. 5. It is an unhappy Age to speak any thing in, that seemeth new, or not common, though but in Method: there being so many Heresies and wicked Doctrines of late sprung up among us, and all under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a progress in knowledge, and of further light, that I cannot blame any wise and godly man to be wary and cautelous what he doth receive. 6. Satan is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all Truth, but especially to <hi>Uniting</hi> and <hi>Reforming Purifying</hi> Truths. 7. Though I offend, I must say that which cannot be hid. Divines are too few that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and diligently studious for Truth, and take not things upon prejudice and trust from a Party: And yet fewer that have strong Judgements, and are able to discern it, though they do study it: When they have followed on an enquiry a little way, and find that truth doth like the branches of a Tree, or the veins in mans body, go smaller and distinct, then are they unable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it any further, and to see the truth in so fine a thred. I arrogate not this to my self, the want whereof I discern in others: but yet I wonder oft at the confidence of such men: and can well say as <hi>August. Epist. 29. Hieronymo. Adversus eos qui sibi videntur scire quod nesciunt, hoc tutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res sumus, quod hanc ignorantiam nostram non Ignoramus:</hi> Which is the scope of much of my <hi>Apol.</hi> against Mr. <hi>K.</hi> 8. I find my self much injured by the excessive estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:118986:21"/> and praises of those that approve of my Labours, I mean the less discreet among them: for that enrageth some others, and whets them on to a contention. I do therefore bespeak all such friends in the words of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Epist. 7. Marcell. Vos autem qui me multum diligitis, si talem me asseritis adversus eos quorum malitia, vel Imperitia, vel Intelligentia reprehendor, ut me nusquam scriptorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum errasse dicatis, frustra laboratis; non bonam causam sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepistis: facile in ea, meipso judice, superamini; Quoniam non mihi placet cum a charissimis meis talis esse existimor, qualis non sum. Profecto enim non me, sed pro me alium, sub meo nomine diligunt, si non quod sum, sed quod non sum, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, the very number of Assenters I find is an offence: but that I cannot help. Good men when they think any Truth to be an Errour, will be sorry that it is entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> thus Prefaceth to Mr. <hi>Eyre's</hi> Book: <hi>For the present I shall only say, That there being too great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a very welcome entertainment, and Acceptance given by Many to an almost pure Socinian Justification and Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of grace, even amongst them into whose hearts God seems to have shined, in some measure, to give the light of the knowledge of his Glory in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> He that should think any Doctrine to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, I wonder not if he think himself bound to oppose it. But to be <hi>Almost</hi> an Errour, is to be a Truth: There is but a thred between Truth and Errour; and that which is not <hi>Neer</hi> to that <hi>Errour,</hi> is not Truth, but is liker to be another Errour in the other extream: For Truth is one strait line, but Errour is manifold; even All that swarveth from that line, in what space and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree soever. I purposed to have said nothing to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother Doctor <hi>Owen;</hi> but when I came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swet the Arguments for Justification, or Absolution, or
<pb facs="tcp:118986:22"/> Remission before Faith, I found my self engaged to do it, because I knew of none that had said so much as he there doth; and because (since the publishing of my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology) two or three reverend Brethren told me that, as to that part, it was thought necessary.</p>
            <p>There is lately come forth a second Part of a Treatise of Justification, by a Reverend Brother; wherein some things which I have delivered are opposed; especially that sincere obedience is a condition, <hi>&amp; causa sine qua non</hi> of our Justification as continued (or <hi>non-amittendi justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> and of final sentential Justification, if he speak to me) He being one of the two to whom I first direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Aphorisms; I there promised, that if he dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would search again, and be the more suspitious of my thoughts: which I have accordingly done. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be my unhappy darkness, or my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his mistake, or what ever the cause be, I am left but the more confident of the Truth of what he opposeth. Certain I am, that I am willing to know the Truth, though it were to tht Retractation of all that I have wrote. The strength of his Arguments lies upon a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that <hi>Conditions have a Moral▪ efficiency▪</hi> which he is pleased to prove by his bare affirmation; yea after I had denied it, both to himself in private writings, and in my Books publickly, and affirmed that its against the common sence of Lawyers, and that a Condition <hi>qua</hi> Condition hath no efficiency, though some Conditions <hi>qua</hi> Meritorious may; yet was he not pleased to take any notice of this, as if his affirmation excluded all need of a further proof. And <hi>pag.</hi> 220. he doth thus state the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Upon what account these are required in justified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? Whether in some causality or concurrence as faith is? only not with such a degree of excellency? Whether good works be required as well as faith, so that we may say, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="tcp:118986:22"/> Repentance, justifying Law, as well as justifying Faith? This is positively and vehemently affirmed by some.</hi> And he plainly shews that it is my self that he speaks of. I do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue that high estimation of this Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which I first did sincerely express. But all men are imperfect: I much desire more candor and truth in these passages. I vehemently disclaimed, 1. All causality of works or Faith to Justification, to himself in private wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. 2. As also I shewed him that if I were guilty of bringing them too neer to an equality, it was by taking down Faith more then he, but not by raising works higher then others. 3. I gave him reasons why it was not fit to say, <hi>Justifying Repentance, Love, &amp;c.</hi> 4. It was so far from my thoughts to talk or think of <hi>Justifying Law,</hi> (if he mean not the Gospel promise, as its like he doth not: for else sure he would not account it strange) that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely wrote against it, and as plainly as I could speak. And yet must I be said, or intimated <hi>vehemently and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively to affirm</hi> such things? Why then, what good will disputing do? Or what Remedy but to appeal to a Juster Judge! That <hi>Credere, to Believe or lay hold on Christ, though they be Grammatical Actions, yet they are naturally passions, as Intelligere, videre, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>pag.</hi> 225. he makes to be the fullest representation of that Truth. This, I say, is the point which I gave him in writing my reasons against, but he here takes no notice of them. Whether my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned promise in my Epistle to <hi>Aphor.</hi> oblige me to a Reply to what is said against me in this Book, I shall consider, as God affordeth me opportunity, and shall hearken to what others advise me to therein. But if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no Reply, I yet conceive my self fully excusable. 1. In that the Author in his Epistle, seemeth to avert it, professing his thoughts against Replying to a whole Book. If I write then, he will take what scraps he please
<pb facs="tcp:118986:23"/> into consideration: and if I Reply to all his, it seems, I shall do what he judgeth unmeet. 2. It so falls out that I have answered him already in this Confession, before I saw his Book: so that I think there needs no more. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be new Doctrine to assert such conditions as I do, and whether his Doctrine, <hi>pag.</hi> 346. be true or tolerable, that <hi>as in Christs suffering we were looked upon by God as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in him; so by Christs obeying of the Law, we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held as fulfilling the Law in him, &amp;c.</hi> I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge, when he hath read what I have here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But I must desire my Reverend Brother not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that I prove this doctrine the very foundation of Antinomianism; For when I did that, I little thought that he would own it: and if I had, I durst not have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. 3. If I may escape the censure of charging my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother with contradictions, or labour in vain, I would desire the Reader to consider, whether after all his gainsaying, he do not openly aver the same doctrine which I maintain? <hi>pag.</hi> 118. he gives us these words, as remarkable in a different Character. <hi>For though holy works do not justifie, yet by them a man is continued in a state and condition of justification: so that did not the Covenant of Grace interpose, gross and wicked wayes would cut off our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and put us in a state of condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Pag. 429. <hi>For although Christ did fulfil the Law for such who are his, yet this is not imputed and accounted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to every one, but its applyed in that way and order which God hath appointed: and that order is to communicate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his active obedience, to none but such who shall by faith receive him, and obedientially walk in his commands.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these things, Reader, and I will not differ with thee about the name of a <hi>Condition.</hi> Call it what you will for me. 4. My last Reason is, because those Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb facs="tcp:118986:23"/> that I have spoke with since they read it, do tell me, that they judge the contradiction to me to be so superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and without proof, that I need not be solicitous to hinder its success: Though for my part, I bear some kinde of reverence even to his mistakes, through my love and reverence to himself.</p>
            <p>And I shall the more easily be perswaded to forbear more writings of this sort, not only because my friends at a distance do so importune me to a more profitable kinde of imployment, but also because it pleaseth God of late to call out more enough to such undertakings. There is newly come out against Antinomianism, as Mr. <hi>Hotch</hi> his Exercitation of Remission of sin, so Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> against Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grail</hi> against him also, for the conditionality of the Covenant of Grace: and both ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, and well worthy the reading: which I willingly say, though the former differ from me about the notion of Faiths instrumentality, and before the later Master <hi>Constant Jessop</hi> hath published a large Epistle to vindicate Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> from that opinion about Justification which I supposed him to be guilty of. And truly I was much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with that Preface when I read it, and said, Its pity it should be upon mistake: and if it be, me thinks (in that case) I am ready to love his mistake, for the charity in it, and the desirableness of the thing asserted, more then my own ungrateful interpretation, though it should be true. And I heartily thank that▪ Reverend Brother for his candid and ingenuous labor; wherein, if he hit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Doctors sense, he hath not only befriended me, for the rectifying of my mistakes, but also befriended the Church, in taking from the Antinomians the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which they seemed to have by the reputation of so Learned a man as Dr <hi>Twiss.</hi> For my own part, I owe more to his writings, for my information in those points,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:24"/> where many are now offended with me for my judgment, then to any writer in the world, except the Scriptures. In particular, it was he that did not only satisfie me in the point of Universal Redemption, but by clearer distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between Gods Preceptive and Decretive will, then I had found others do, did help me to discern bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then before I had done, between the Physical and Ethical considerations in Theologie, and did let in that light at so narrow a crevise, which hath not been a little serviceable to me since then. And indeed it was Doctor <hi>Twiss</hi> that first drew me out of the road that I was in, if I have in any particulars forsaken it. And the next advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I had, was by reading <hi>Saltmarsh</hi>'s Flowings of Grace: which I saw so exceedingly taking both in the Country and the Army (where I then was) that I fell on the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perusal and consideration of it: and its palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were a most usefull discovery to me of some contrary Truths, while I was endeavoring to confute him; so that when I considered of the justest answer to his conceits about Christs Believing, Repenting and Obeying for us; it plainly lead me to the discerning of that necessity of the twofold Righteousness, which some inconsideratly quarrel at. And a long vacancy in deep weakness of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, presently succeeding the beginning of these thoughts, did much more enforce them then before.</p>
            <p>This much more I must say concerning this present Confession. 1. The large citations of other mens words must needs seem tedious to many Readers, but I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to it, as the only answer to the Argument of singularity which I am charged with, and which seemeth the most effectual that they plead. And I hope the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of those citations will prove worth the reading.</p>
            <p>2. If any Brother understand not any word in my <hi>Aphorisms</hi> which is here interpreted, or mistake my sense
<pb facs="tcp:118986:24"/> about the Matetr of that Book, which is here more fully opened, I must expect that they interpret That by This. And if any one have so little to do, as to write against that Book (which is not unlikely) if he take the sense con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what I have here, and elsewhere since then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, I shall but neglect him as a contentious vain wrangler, if not a Calumniator.</p>
            <p>If any will needs take any thing in this Book to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Retractation, then an Explication of what I have before said though I should best know my own meaning, yet do such commend me, while they seem to blame me: And for my part I never look to write that which shall have no need of correction, remembring how <hi>Austine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooled one contrary minded; and I say as he in another place, <hi>Epist. 7.

Aut nihil scribendum fuit, ne hominum Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium subiremus, quod tu facere prohibuisti: aut scribentes cognoscere cunctorum adversum nos maledicorum tela tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenda: Quos obsecro ut quiescant, &amp; desinant maledicere: non enim ut Adversariis, sed ut Amicis scripsimus: Nec in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecti sumus in eos, qui peccant, sed ne peccent monuimus:
<pb facs="tcp:118986:25"/> Ne{que} in illos tantum sed in nosmetipsos severi Iudices fuimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main discouragement that I find in writing of hard controversies, is, because there are so few of the people (to say nothing of the younger, or duller of the Ministry) that are able to make tryal, and discern when a cause is well maintained, and when not: But a man that will confidently pour out words, how far so ever he <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> from the Truth or mark, is as soon believed, as he that giveth the soundest Reasons, saith <hi>Hierom▪ (Ubi supr. p. 14.) Nil tam facile quam vilem plebeculam &amp; indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam Concionem linguae volubilitate decipere; quae quicquid non intelligit, plus Miratur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after all this any Brother shall yet confidently charge me with error, I promise him to be diligent in my endeavours to know the Truth: and me thinks I may expect, that whoever so chargeth me, should in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have these Qualifications following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he be a man of a stronger Judgement, and more Discerning Head; and not one of those that <hi>Nazianz.</hi> describes <hi>Orat.</hi> 1. (and after, p. 453.) that think themselves wise enough to be Teachers or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict others, when they have got two or three words of Scripture: Nor such as have not wit for an ordinary business, and yet think that they can master the deepest Controversies. He that thinks to do this without a piercing wit, (as well as Grace) ordinarily, thinks to see without eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I expect that he be one that hath longer and more diligently and seriously exercised himself in these stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, then I have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he be one more free from prejudice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality then I am: who, I must needs say, have been deeply convinced of the evil of detaining any Truth in
<pb facs="tcp:118986:25"/> unrighteousness, upon any interest of a Party that is against it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he have more of the illumination of Gods Spirit, which is the chief.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That he have a more sanctified heart, that he may not be led away with wrong ends, or blinded by his vices.</p>
            <p>Usually all these are conjunctly necessary: but at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st there must be so much of the chief, as may supply the want of the rest. And as in all these I unfeignedly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my defectiveness, and doubt not but there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Labourers in Gods Vineyard, with whom in these respects, I am unworthy to be named; so it is these whose judgements I shall value; but for empty, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, self-conceited ones, that know not what they talk against, I shall regard them as they deserve. I did not easily or rashly fix upon that which they mislike; I was once of their mind in some of those points; and I doubt not but they are verily perswaded that they are right: or else they would not be so zealous in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But as confident men as they, and perhaps as able, have seen Truth in some of these things, which they formerly reproached as errors: of whom I may say, as <hi>Austin</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> (in their measure) <hi>Epist. 203.

            </p>
            <p>I am sensible of the trouble that I have put the Reader to buy this tedious Preface: But I remember that <hi>Austin Epist. 23. Bonifac.</hi> saith of his friend <hi>Nebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> that he exceedingly hated a short Answer to a Great Question, and took it very ill of any that expected the like from him, and where he might be free, would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his indignation.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader take notice that this Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the last part of my Apology, yea most of it, before I heard of Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> death, which was about a fortnight after I saw his Book: And therefore I make more mention of him then else I would have done. It hath (I know not on what impediments) stuck much longer in the Press then I expected.</p>
            <p>The Printed sheets were perused by some Learned, Reverend men, whose Judgements I most highly valued; And I resolved and promised them, for the sake of Peace and Truth, to correct and reprint every sheet, where any material passage should be found, which they judged Erroneous: But upon perusal, they desire not the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any, but approve of the passing of it, as I sent it them.</p>
            <p>One of these was that now-blessed man Mr. <hi>T. Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> who lived not to peruse it all: but on the chief and most material part, he left me those brief Notes, which I have annexed to the end: And because it pleased▪
<pb facs="tcp:118986:26"/> the Lord to make this his last work on earth, and to Conclude his Labours in the dictating of an affectionate Valediction and Benediction, which he sent to me with those Notes, I have adjoyned these also; the Memory of his Name, and of his great Love and Respects, being to me so precious. Two other Letters of his I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned also, wherein he was pleased of his own Accord to declare his Judgement of three other of my writings; which I oppose (as sufficient against the quarrelsome exceptions of Contenders. Had I not been confident that he desired not the keeping secret of these his thoughts, I should not have dared to make them publike; nor would I be in the least injurious to the name which I so much honour, that thereby I might borrow Honour to my own. The Lord pardon all our failings and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our imperfect labours to the good of his Church.</p>

Mr. <hi>Joh. Owens</hi> Reasons examined, whereby he would prove
<pb facs="tcp:118986:28"/> that Ʋnbelivers have Right to Iustification, and the other Good things purchased by Christ: and that they dyed with Christ: Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers are not absolved from the guilt of▪ sin, and the obligation to Death and Hell▪ as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> supposeth them to be. <hi>Sect. 5.</hi> Two or three necessary Distinctions and Considerations for them that would escape the Antinomian delusions, which are proved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of the substance of Christian Religion.</p>

It was the first that I published, and I was then a stranger to the dispositions of Divines, and simply thought that none would be offended with one that held the same Christian Doctrine▪ for attempting a clearer explication of it, though he differed from them in lesser things; yea, though he failed in his attempt, as long as he abhorred dividing from the Church: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thought I might have boldly said to Christian Ministers, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> did to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>Apolog.</hi> 1. Fin <hi>These things we offer to your considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If they seem agreeable to Reason and Verity, honor them, but if they seem toys, as toys contemn them, but do not hostilely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118986:30"/> them.</hi> But I am now a little better acquainted with the world, and the best part of the world then before I was. The Reasons of my publishing that book (at first drawn forth by the occasion of one Question, about the sence of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.) were these: 1. A hope of clearer discovery of some common Truths, by dispelling some confusions, and some cloudy novel groundless distinctions; That so when truth was more clearly seen, it might be more deeply received, affectionatly entertained, firmly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and successfully improved. 2. A strong conceit that I should take out of the hands of many adversaries (Papists, Pelagians and Libertines) some great advantages which formerly some have given them against us, and should clear in some measure, the way of a more effectual confutation of their Errors. Especially, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, mine eye was upon the Libertines, commonly called Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, through the whole, being wakened to a compassion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant well meaning Christians, who were then following their delusions in a full career. 3. A hope also▪ I had that many Christians who had seemed to differ more then indeed they did, in these points, might be brought to an Agreement by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth; at least that meer verbal differences might not seem Real and Doctrinal.</p>
            <p>But I quickly found that some thought too well, and some too ill of what I had written. Lest therefore I should prove a further offence to my Brethren, and a wrong to the Church; I desired those that thought it worth their labor to vouchsafe me their Animadversions, which I have spent much of these three last years in considering, that I might Correct whatsoever was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be Erroneous, and give them an account of my Reasons of the rest. I have not only since suppressed that Book which did offend them, but also laid by those Papers of Universal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I had written, lest I should be further offensive. But I find all this gives no satisfaction. Some further course therefore I am obliged to take: For if the offence had been only taken and not given, yet Christian Charity binds me to do my best to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it: But when I do freely confess that some part of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was given by me, by some indigested and obscure passages, and some over-sights in that book, I am much more bound to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the offended, as far as is in my power to do.</p>
            <p>To this end I have two sorts of men to address my speech to.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118986:30"/> 1. Those Divines that go the way of the Libertines (commonly called Antinomians) in whole or in part: For these I perceive are most deeply offended with me. 2. Some Orthodox sober Divines, who are offended with me for some lesser differences, wherein I seem to them to affect singularity, and too easily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Common judgement of the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do confess (being once half ensnared my self in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Justification before Faith, and that Justification by Faith, was but</hi> in foro Conscientiae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I have a strong apprehension of the danger of those Doctrines, and their concomitants: and that upon four grounds. 1. Either I am exceedingly mistaken, or else they do as directly and fully subvert the main scope of the Doctrine of Christ, as any Errors that I know of in <hi>England,</hi> that are maintained by any considerable number of men who have any great appearance of Piety and Sobriety. Were <hi>England</hi> well rid but of Libertinism, Socinianism and Popery, it were a happy Land: But the first party do more dangerously insinuate with the weaker sort of Godly people then either of the latter, by the advantage of the name of Free-grace, and by their pretences to a singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling of Christ, and by their declaiming against legal Preachers, and against the advancement of our own Works or Righteousness, and especially by leading men in so easie a way, which flesh and blood hath so little against, as being too consistent with mens Carnal Interest. 2. The evident tendency also of these licentious Doctrines to a licentious Life, and to the destruction of Godliness, I confess doth increase my detestation of them. He that seeth not in the face of them written, an opposition to Mortification and Watchfulness, and the life of Godliness, seeth not with my eyes. 3. The experience which we have seen of the real Issue, and sad effects of this licentious Doctrine, I confess hath further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me against it. I am none of those that shut my eyes against the workings of Providence, nor yet against the discoveries of Causes in their Effects. Three black Clouds of Witnesses we have of this. 1. The unhappy miscarriages, and shameful lives of those Libertines that lived in <hi>England</hi> before these late years of trouble. Whereof both <hi>London,</hi> and the Grundletonians in <hi>York-shire,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I have heard from an ancient Godly man that knew</hi> Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>and</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger, <hi>that they were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the spirit of the</hi> Grundletoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>The same man affirmed that he went but once among them himself, and after prayer they breathed on him, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the holy Ghost, and he was so strangely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for three days, that he was not as the same man: and his family wondered what was the matter with him the had no confession of sin, but an elevated strain in Prayer, as if he had been in strange raptures: and after three days he was as before, and came no more at them.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Arthingtons Seduction,</hi> with the whole story of <hi>Hacket</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118986:31"/>
               <hi>Coppinger,</hi> can give too full Testimony. 2. The sad miscarriages of this Sect in <hi>New-England,</hi> whererof see Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> his <hi>Rise and ruine of Antinomianism in N. E.</hi> 3. Their late Actions in old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> since (uniting with the spirit of Anabaptistry, the far smaller evil) they have proceeded as far as <hi>Ranting,</hi> hath further shewed what spirit they are of, to those that will see the Sun at Noon-day: Nor have the Publique transactions or attempts of the more subtile among them, much honored their Principles in the eyes of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and judicious through the Land. 4. And (which I have oft mentioned, and will do while I can speak) the Miracles of God against them in New <hi>England</hi> were so real a Testimony from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I am resolved to take them for a Decision of that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, being conjunct with so full a Testimony of the word. Three Sects did all lately imbody together, Anabaptists, Separatists and Antinomians, and so made up one, (though some of the first sort disclaimed the last, and went the <hi>Pelagian</hi> way:) And what man dare obscure the witness that God hath given against them, unless he will be found a fighter against God? I profess, for my part, I am fully satisfied from plain Scripture against them, though I had seen no further witness; But yet should I shut mine eyes against such a Testimony as God hath given in <hi>New-England</hi> by those Monsters, and in <hi>Old-England,</hi> by multitudes of fouler Monsters, even Ranters, Quakers, Seekers and Blasphemers, I should sure be guilty of a hainous sin. God doth not ordinarily thus appear; but very rarely, and in great extremities, and against those that his soul doth deeply detest. And to wink at such wonders, what is it but to despise God in the dreadfullest of his works? They that can read the book of Providence, and expound it so well as some pretend, and yet overlook such Providences as these, shall be no Tutors of mine, in the Exposition of this blessed Book.</p>
            <p>These Reasons having excited my Zeal against this Sect above many others, I have accordingly judged it my duty to bend my self against them in all my writings: Especially when I saw how greedily multitudes of poor souls did take the bait, and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly the Writings and Preachings of <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> and many of his fellows did take with them. Upon this I perceive the men that in any measure go that way, are enraged against me: How to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them I know not. I would as willingly know the truth as some of them, if I could. Sure I am, I have as much Reason. My
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118986:31"/> soul should be as precious to me; Christ should be as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued: Grace should be as much magnified: Self should be as much denyed. I am as deeply beholden to Christ and Free-Grace as most poor sinners in the world: And should I vilifie or wrong them, for an Opinion, or I know not what I Every man that is drawn from Christ, is drawn by some contrary prevailing Interest: What interest should draw me to think meanly of my Saviour, or his Free-Grace? For Free-Remission alone without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an Eternal Justification; I do not perceive but that my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Carnal part would fain have it to be true. I have flesh as well as they; and if I am able to discern the pleadings or inclinations of that flesh, it runs their way in contradiction to the Spirit. And the Lord knows I have as little reason to extol my own Righteousness, or place my confidence in Works and Merits, as other men have. I must truly say, The Lord holdeth my sins much more before mine eyes then my Good-Works: The one are Mountains to me, the other I can scarce tell whether I may own in propriety, without many Cautions and Limitations. I have therefore no Carnal interests of my own that I can possibly discover, to lead me against the way of these men, or Engage me to contend against them. Yet am I not able to forbear. I confess I am an unreconcileable Enemy to their Doctrines, and so let them take me: I had as live tell them so, as hide it. The more I pray God to illuminate me in these things, the more am I animated against them. The more I search after the truth in my Studies, the more I dislike them. The more I read their own Books, the more do I see the Vanity of their Conceits: But above all, when I do but open the Bible, I can seldom meet with a leaf that is not against them. And what further means I should use, besides Prayer, Study, Reading their Books, and Reading the Scripture, I do not remember. If they blame my <hi>Will,</hi> I cannot find any Byas against them, from fleshly interest (as I said) but from spiritual. Nor am I able to Believe what men would have me, nor whatsoever I would my self. My will hath not the full command of my Belief. If they blame my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will blame it too, but I cannot clear it. Only I am resolved to wait on God in the use of his means, and by the help of his Grace, to search as diligently for the Truth as I can, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem my time thereto as much, and spare my f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esh as little, as will stand with my life, and a freedom from the sin of self-murder. And if yet I must differ, ther's no remedy.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118986:32"/>
            <p>The indignation of these exasperated men, hath found out of late a strange kind of vent. To be revenged on me for calling them Antinomians, they have resolved to call me Arminian, Socinian, Papist, and Jesuite; Yea, and as if they were in good sadness, to perswade the world that by Antinomians, I mean Anti-papists and that I am indeed a down-right Papist, and of the grosser sort too, and that I subtilly endeavour the propagation of Popery, and all my pretences to the contrary are but Jesuitical dissembling: And in particular, that there is no Papists, that speak more for Merits then I do. To this purpose it seemed good to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> to write in his Book against Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridge,</hi> on which I have sent him my Admonition: In which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth one Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> that was writing against me, whose writing is now come forth in the light: Such a piece as I confess my eyes never saw before: The lively picture of the wiser sort of Libertines: Expressing much of that in Print, which the Ranters do in transient actions: so much palpable darkness, so many mistakes of my sence, so many errors, and so much presumption, is there congested; But above all, so many notorious falshoods in matter of fact, as I do profess I never saw in one volume to my knowledge, either of Jesuite, or any the vilest Heretick. I would be loath to bestow my time in numbering them, till my Arithmetick be better; Only Ile say, that I yet have not observed one leaf in all that great Volume that hath not many: How many hundred then may such a bulk contain? What an unsavory, uncleanly task would it be to Reply to such a man, if I had so little wit, and so many words and hours as such a work requires? And indeed it could not be better in matter of truth, when the whole Volume is animated with one falshood, as the soul of it; That is, that I am a Papist: This is the whole from first to last: If you have this, in the dress of a <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Dialect, you have all. Hence is the man carried, even where I speak that which he cannot reprehend, to enter into the secrets of my soul, and lay open my heart, for the expounding of my lines, and to tell them over and over that I do but subtilly aequivocate and dissemble; I say one thing, but I mean or think another, so that he hath written a Volume much in the confutation of my most secret thoughts; yea, of such as he feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, contrary to the full expression of my writings. I confess when I read the first leaf that I opened at, it seemed to me a sad, yet for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118986:32"/> the gravity of the Fiction, a ridiculous Object; to see the man come upon the Stage, and act his part so confidently and seriously, as if he did verily think I were a Papist indeed. That I am a Papist, or that I must be an Antinomian, are equally credible to me: And if there be no middle way between those two, I confess I am I know not where. I deny not but all Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> commendations of this man may be true: But then if voluminous slanders, and gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest falshoods, considerately Printed and Published, may consist with Grace, and such eminency of Grace too in the leaders of the flocks, I would advise these Brethren hereafter to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should not be very compassionate to others, and how they do Judge of the qualification of their Church-members. To cast out or censure a member for swearing or lying once or twice, when the Pastor may slander and rail voluminously, is scarce equal dealing. Truly when I read this mans Book, it forced me to say, Oh what a depraved nature hath man! what a dark understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! what a deceitful heart! what a sad case are our poor people in, when their guides are in such darkness and contention! what a patient God have we! and what reason therefore to be patient with one another?</p>
            <p>If any expect that I should particularly Reply to that Book, I must say of that and of divers others that have been lately publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against me (<hi>Fisher, Keyes, Hagger:</hi>) my time is like to be but short on earth: I live in pain and languishing, and expectations of my change, and therefore I dare not wast so short, so precious time on such an imployment; Nor dare I give such an account<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before I saw Mr.</hi> Caryls <hi>Epistle, which gave me a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call to say so much to Mr.</hi> Crandon, <hi>as I have since done.</hi>
               </note> of those hours to God, which he hath given me for better and more useful works. If any object, that the ignorance of common people is such, that confidence, and railing, and slanders will take with them, as if they were valid Arguments, and therefore have need of as diligent confutation; I answer, it is not in my power to cure the ignorance of such people, nor the slanderous tongues or pens of such Writers; And if I must Write as long as slanderers will make me work, or ignorant men need it, then I shall have work enough to do, and my labours be at the command of every mans Vices. If any object, that I owe it to my own Reputation, I <hi>Ans.</hi> I Write not for my self, nor for so low an end; But for the good of others. And whereas some say, that I am bound to vindicate my Reputation, that I may not hinder other mens profiting by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118986:33"/> my labors. I <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If God take away my Reputation, he will no more expect I should serve him by it, then he will expect I should serve him by health or wealth when he hath taken them away: Nor doth he expect that I should be so solicitous for its recovery as to neglect any greater work the while. 2. God hath permitted the Columniator to play his part so grosly, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert those things voluminously and confidenrly which contradict themselves, and which all that know me, know to be false, that I think such a tongue is not much capable of diminishing a mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, nor is it any way needful to Vindicate it from such.</p>
            <p>Yet though I will not give a particular answer to any such Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as these are, I shall against the whole substance and scope of the undertaking anon prove against Mr. <hi>Crandon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that the Papists give more to works then I do, and I shall give them the Confession of my faith, that they may truly know how much I give to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But first I must take notice of the other sort, who have been offended in the respects forementioned at my Doctrine, and whom I am more obliged to satisfie; and because the things they blame me for, are 1. Some mistakes in Doctrine. 2. Affectation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. 3. Or at least too easie dissenting from the judgement of the Orthodox; For the first, I am left uncapable of satisfying them: For change my judgement I cannot, till evidence of truth do it: And if I should, it would not serve turn: For then I should offend all on the other side, who are for that Doctrine which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver: So that man-pleasing is a frivolous; yea, an impossible work. And to give them the Reasons of my judgement, will but offend them more; for I find men are impatient of contradiction, and of uttering that which is against their opinions But to go as far as I am able to satisfie both these offended parties, both the Hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox slanderers, and the Orthodox sober Godly Divines (I mean so many of them as are offended▪ for very many I know are not) I shall now in order perform these several things following. 1. I will make a true confession of my faith, by which you may Judge of Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> charge of Popery, Socinianism, Arminianism, &amp;c. 2. To the General Confession I will add a more particular account, how much I give to mans Works, and how much I deny to them. 3. Because Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> affirm so boldly, that by Antinomians, I mean Antipapists,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118986:33"/> (that they might get the honorable Title of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion put upon their Opinions) I shall tell you what it is that I mean by Antinomianism. 4. Because they contend so much for justification before faith, and that Justification by faith is but <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> or terminated in Conscience, I shall give my Reasons against both those Assertions. 5. I shall shew how modestly Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> do aver that the Papists (yea none of the Papists) give no more to Works or Merits then I. 6. I shall prove that I am not so singular, as is supposed, and that I do give no more to Works, then the Reformed Churches and Divines ordinarily do; by a large recital of their own words. And in the performances of these six things lyes all the satisfaction that I yet understand my self able to give to those that are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Supposing what I have said in the Preface.</p>

               <p>BEcause Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> is pleased through his Book to affirm with<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> such confidence that I do subtilly equivocate and dissemble my judgement, hiding the worst, and meaning one thing when I speak another, and so leaves me uncapable by any Profession, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations or Oaths, of satisfying any who are of his mind; and as audaciously arrogate the Prerogative of God, in knowing and judging the heart of man, even against his own Professions; I shall therefore premise only this general profession to them who will believe it, and they that will not may choose. <hi>I will never worship and serve that God, that I do not believe to be able and willing to bear me out in his service; and save me harmless, and see that I be no loser by my owning him and his will. The God whom I serve I am sure is both able and willing. I will never serve a God that I have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118986:34"/> cause to be ashamed of. To be ashamed of him, is so far to deny him to be God. Nor will I ever be of that Religion which gives men leave to lye, and to deny it: My Religion doth not: To deny it therefore, is so far to disclaim and renounce it: Therefore so far as I deny it, so far I am not of that Religion. I believe that no man shall be saved by the Christian Religion that will not lay down his life rather then deny it: Much less he that will not let go the favor and esteem of men: and especially he that prefers his credit with such a man as Mr.</hi> Crandon, <hi>before his Religion, hath sure very low thoughts of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and mean expectations from it, and may well look that his Reward should be answerable.</hi> So much for Preface.</p>
               <p>1. I Do Believe the Holy Canonical Scriptures, and all things therein contained to be infallibly true, as being the Word of God. And I do Believe it to be a sufficient and perfect Rule or Law, needing no Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Tradition, or Humane Testimony to supply its defects, though it suppose some Tradition and Humane Testimony as necessary to its Promulgation and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>I suppose this single Confession freeth me from the charge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and of Popery: For an Infidel believes not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Papist believes it to be but part of Gods Word, and Tradition the other part; and upon that ground they let in all their inventions and Will-worship. And seeing the main point wherein we differ from the Papists, is in maintaining the sufficiency of the Scripture, I suppose I need not add any Creed or other Confession as necessary to be subscribed, as if this word alone were an insufficient Test, to try by who is Orthodox, and of the right Religion. So that I think I have in this made a sufficient Confession, did not mens misapprehensions require more.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Papists believe the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Blessed be God for it: But they believe not its suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, but take it, as I said, to be but part of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Socinians and Arminians believe the sufficiency of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118986:34"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So long there is the more hope of their reduction. But they believe not some plain particular Doctrines of Scripture: The Socinians believe not the Godhead of Christ, or the Holy Ghost, though the first be oft in terms, and the latter at least in sence, expressed in the Scripture: Nor do they believe Christs satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore they do not believe the Doctrine of the Scriptures, though they believe in general that the Scripture is true. If any will prove that I deny any Doctrine of that word which in general I believe, I will revoke it when I see it so proved: In the mean time I protest, that it is my resolution to search as impartially after the true meaning of the word as I can, and that I would fain know the mind of God therein, though it cost me the utmost pains, and the loss of mens estimation and favour, and though my greatest Temptation to partiality in my studies doth lye in my loathness to dissent from Godly Divines, whom I most highly value and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and whose love I more esteem then any other mens; Yet, by the Grace of God, I resolve as faithfully as I can, to resist even this Temptation also, and to lay open my soul to the teachings of Christ by his Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>But because it is expected that there be a more particular profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the several Doctrines contained in this Word; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I confess such a Profession very fit and necessary in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, (it being not every word in Scripture that is of flat neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to Salvation, it is very fit that those which be so, should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and explicitely be believed) I shall descend to such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. And because the summ of my Belief for Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is expressed in our late <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> Profession of faith, I shall here recite it (because it is but short) with the change of one word for abbreviation: Supposing the Apostles Creed.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118986:35"/> and happiness, under the wrath of God, the curse of his Law, and the power of the Devil, God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son to be their Redeemer, who being God, and one with the Father, did take to him our nature, and became man, being conceived of the Holy Ghost in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her, and named Jesus Christ; and having lived on earth without sin, and wrought many Miracles for a witness of his truth, he gave up himself a Sacrifice for our sins, and a Ransom for us, in suffering death on the Cross: and being Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he Rose again the third day, and afterward ascended into heaven, where he is Lord of all in Glory with the Father: And having Ordained that all that truly Repent and Believe in him, and love him above all things, and sincerely obey him, and that to the death, shall be saved, and they that will not shall be damned, and commanded his Ministers to Preach the Gospel to the world; he will come again and raise the bodies of all men from death, and will Judge all men according to what they have done in the body; and the Righteous shall go into life Eternal, and the rest into everlasting punishment.</p>
               <p>I believe that God the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of the Father and the Son, was sent from the Father <note n="*" place="margin">Or, [<hi>and the Son] which you will.</hi>
                  </note> by the Son, to Inspire and Guide the Prophets and Apostles, that they might fully reveal the Doctrine of Christ: and by multitudes of evident Miracles and wonderful gifts, to be the great witness of Christ and of the truth of his holy word, and also to dwell and work in all that are drawn to believe, that being first joyned to Christ their Head, and into one Church, which is his body, and so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and made the sons of God, they may be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people sanctified to Christ, and may mortifie the flesh, and overcome the world and the Devil, and being zealous of good works, may serve God in Holiness and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118986:35"/> Righteousness, and may live in the special Love and Communion of the Saints, and in hope of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of Everlasting Life.</p>
               <p>I do heartily take this one God, for my only God and<note place="margin">Profession of Consent.</note> my chief good; and this Jesus Christ for my only Lord, Redeemer and Saviour; and this Holy Ghost for my Sanctifier; and the Doctrine by him revealed, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by his Miracles, and now contained in the holy Scriptures, I do take for the Law of God, and the Rule of my faith and life. And Repenting unfeignedly of my sins, I do resolve through the Grace of God sincerely to obey him, both in holiness to God, and Righteousness to men, and in special love to the Saints, and Communion with them, against all the temptations of the Devil, the World, and my own Flesh, and this to the Death.</p>
               <p>I do also take the ten Commandments for a general standing Rule of obedience: And the Lords Prayer for a perfect rule for prayer, most admirable for Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of matter, and exactness of Method. And I believe that Christ hath instituted Baptism for our enterance into his Church, and the Lords Supper for our Confirmation; and hath appointed ministers to be the teachers of his Church, and to guide it in Concord, according to his Word.</p>
               <p>THis is my Religion: This I profess, subscribe and stand to. If any man ask what Religion I am of, hither I refer him. If this be not enough for him, but he must needs have yet a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or else he will not account me Orthodox, let him take his course, and judge of me as he please. He that professeth this, and lives accordingly, shall by me be taken for a good Christian, by what name or title soever men call him. I say as <hi>Hilary, quod non per difficiles quaestiones ad vitam beatam nos ducat Deus.</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will profess but this much, and not subvert it when they have done by evident contradiction, I will acknowledge them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118986:36"/> as Brethren of the same Religion with me; and if they will unite upon these terms, I will unite with them: Though if they add superfluities which do not subvert this Doctrine, I will not joyn with them in any of those Additions; but let them build their stubble alone for me.</p>
               <p>As to my self, if any man will prove that I hold any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one word of this Confession, I will presently renounce it. In the mean time, if I should hold any thing contrary to it, it is ignorantly, and upon supposition that it is not contrary. And therefore no man can charge me with the not believing any thing here contained: For I renounce any thing in my writings that is contrary to this, though unknown: and if I cannot hold any other of my Opinions, and this confession both, I disclaim all such Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and will let go them, and not this.</p>
               <p>Thus much might well serve as a discovery of my Belief, were it not that prejudice and jealousie requires more: I add therefore.</p>

               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p>3. I Do heartily approve of the shorter Catechism of the<note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Assembly, and of all therein contained: and I take it for the best Catechism that ever I yet saw, and the Answers continued for a most excellent summ of the Christian faith and Doctrine, and a fit Test to try the Orthodoxness even of Teachers themselves.</p>
               <p>I Know the faith of many in these latter Ages of the world is more extensive then intensive, grasping at much in the Object, but little and feeble in the act, and infirmly radicated in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. These men will think that I am yet too short to be accounted Orthodox, and that in embracing this Catechism, it is but a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish faith that I embrace. But I am bold to tell them these things by way of Answer. 1. <hi>Theologia est scientia Affectiva-practica.</hi> God hath laid more on the heart and hand, and less on the head, as to the extent of knowledge, then such men take notice of, We
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118986:36"/> may find us work enough, yea and make a happy progress and growth, by an increase of our firmness, and clearness in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the common truths, and an improvement of them on the heart and life. And it had been happy for the Church in all Ages, especially this, if they had looked more after this kind of growth in knowledge, (as to intension, affection, and execution) and less gaped after new Light and Revelation, and an extensive increase. Though yet I would have none under-value Gods grace in this kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, nor neglect any due means for the attaining of it. 2. I would have these men that have such a swelled belief, to compare the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies shorter Catechism, not only with the Epistles which the Apostles wrote to particular Churches, but with all the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith that were made for four hundred years after Christ in the Church; and see if any of them used a more extensive form? Nay, all the Creeds and Confessions of the Church set together for many hundred years (except the Scriptures) were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this, for fulness and exactness of order and expression. Only in the point of the Mysterie of the Trinity, you may find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more copious, and wordy, as urged to it by the several Heresies of those times. But whether they are therefore ever the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, I will not presume to censure. Nay, what talk I of Creeds and Confessions, when you may read many and many Volumes of the Fathers that contain not so much of the body of <hi>Theologie,</hi> as this Catechism. I speak not this in any contempt or diminution of the Authority of the Writings of the Fathers and first Ages of the Church: I do in several other respects (for their reverend Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, their better opportunity to know the way of the Apostles in matters of fact, &amp;c.) prefer them before any Writings of these times, and so give them the Preheminence <hi>secundum quid;</hi> but <hi>simplicitèr,</hi> and for the innate worth of the Writings themselves, I prefer the latter, and specially this in question much before them.</p>
               <p>3. Further let the Objectors consider whether this were not the first corrupting of the Church and the Christian Doctrine, by being, as I may say, Orthodox over-much, and making too strict paths for other men to walk in, and enlarging the borders of their Belief too far, and condemning all that entertained not the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of some. Also whether this were not the great cause of all the sad divisions that in all Ages have distracted and disturbed the Church, and proved the greatest disgrace and hindrance to our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118986:37"/> Religion. The <hi>Quartoderimani,</hi> the <hi>Audiani,</hi> and many more Hereticks, might well have gone for Catholicks, had it not been for this <hi>Diotrephes.</hi> And will no experience warn us? 4. Nay, consider whether this be not the very disease of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the mark of that beast, to obtrude their superfluities and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Confessions on others? Had the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed but broke off about the middle, (at the end of the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Constinopolita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> Creed) we had been all agreed in matter of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>I have heard divers object, that this is but the trick of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that hold somewhat which dare not see the light, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must either take up with the bare Scripture Expressions, or if they yield to any Confessions, they must be short and general, that they discover not, and contradict not their Errors: and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Socinians are guilty of this. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I might as truly say, this is the Objection of the Papists, to charge an insufficiency on the expressions of Scripture, and make it the property of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks to appeal only to the Scripture: And thus we may fling Popery and Socinianism in one anothers faces, with more spleen then wit. 2. Certainly many such Divines have done more by such indiscreet Objections, to strengthen that unhappy Sect (the Socinians) then they could ever have done for themselves. When men plead reason for Christianity and Scripture Authority, they say, It is Socinianism: when we plead for the sufficiency of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, and appeal to it; they say, This is Socinianism too. Make the World believe once that the Socinians have reason and Scripture on their side; that is, the Light and Law of Nature, and the Light and Law of supernatural Revelation, and who would not turn Socinian? Its pitty that these men can find no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to use against Socinians, but the very same which is the Papists <hi>Goliah</hi> against the Reformed Churches and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>5. I will add this much more for your consideration. Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have hitherto observed, that it is a suspitious sign that any affection or course is not of God, which nature is very prone to; and that the contrary is of God which nature is backward to. Though I know this Rule needs some limitations, yet I think it not unuseful in such cases as this. I have ever observed that a violent Passion called Zeal for a mans opinions, which he accounts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, is so easie and natural, that there needs little means to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118986:37"/> kindle it: Nay, all the means that can be used will scarce allay the inordinate rage of it: But a Zealous love of God, and delight in him, and a Zeal for holiness, and against sin, and a Zealous love to Gods Truths as they hold forth Christ and Glory, and guide us to duty, this is so contrary to the nature of man, that no means is sufficient to excite it. O how easily without Grace, and against Grace do Carnal Ministers, and professors make a huge bussel in the world for their opinions, compassing Sea and Land to make a Proselite! they will ride and go with unwearied diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their opinions; perhaps some of them true, (though as usually false) Truly I have wondred many a time what it should be, that animates such men with so implacable a thirst, to make all others of their own mind, that they care not to venture all they have for it; yea, to subvert Kingdoms, and cast off natural affection to their nearest friends. It is no more love to Christ and his word, and will, then others have: For they are cold enough in obeying his will, and venture to disobey him more easily then others. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is Idolatrous pride. Every man naturally being his own Idol, he would have all others bow down and worship him, and would have the glory of perfect light, and infallibility, and have his judgement be the Rule of all other mens, and would be a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to the world, that is, would be God: I know Gods truth cannot too much be loved: But I know withall, that a proud affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the honor of knowing more then others, and being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the secrets of God, is a thing that a man may get without Grace, but cannot get down without Grace. From whence it comes to pass, that the worst sort of men are often the most Zealous and violent contenders for that which they call the Orthodox Doctrine, when yet the affectionate and practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the very Creed, they do abhor. Witness the doleful state of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath so many hundred Jesuites and others that wholly devote their lives to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their opinions, which they call, and take to be, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, and Orthodox Doctrine: Witness the Fire and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, the Inquisitions, the bloody Massacres, by which this fire of Zeal for Opinions, hath found vent, and made its eruptions. And though it too ordinarily falls out that the pretenders to Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxness are not the most Orthodox, and the most erroneous are readiest to cry down Errors, yet no doubt, but a carnal mind may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118986:38"/> make Gods own pretious truths the occasion of this forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned sin, and may hate the Communion of Saints, even when he is Zealous for the Catholike Church, the forgiveness of sins, or the Resurrection of the body.</p>
               <p>But yet I am not so singular as to make this a pretence for my own Errors; and therefore to give fuller satisfaction, I further add.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>4. I Have perused the larger Catechism of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> and judge it a most excellent summ of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and so much the more excellent, in that it is spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the difficult, and more abstruse part, and most full in the practical part: And I find no word that I dissent from, so I may have leave but to interpret four words, as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHere it is said, that <hi>the Covenant of Grace was made with Christ, as the second</hi> Adam, <hi>and in him, with all the Elect.</hi> I understand it of the <hi>Genus</hi> of the Covenant, one species being made with Christ, and another with man, and not as if it were one and the same Covenant <hi>in specie</hi> that was made with Christ and with man: though I acknowledge that the promise made to Christ, contained the Salvation of his Elect as the matter of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where it is said: <hi>Nor as if the Grace of faith, or any act thereof were imputed to him for his Justification:</hi> 1. I understand it thus, and so assent to it, that <hi>our faith is not imputed to us, as being instead of a perfect Righteousness of obedience, to the ends as it was required by the Law of Works, nor is our faith the matter, or the meritorious cause of the Remission of our sin, our right to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I think this is the meaning of the Reverend Assembly (if I may think that they had all one meaning) and that in sence I differ not from them. 2. But I will never subscribe these words,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118986:38"/> nor any like them, without the liberty of an explication, when they are expresly <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>As in the Confession of Faith.</hi> cap. 11. §. 1.</note>
                  <hi>in terminis,</hi> contrary to the Scripture, and must have such an interpretation to reconcile the sence. Nor will I ever approve of such passages in Catechisms and Confessions, as shall determine a point expresly against the words of God, though Hereticks might abuse those words; but would rather distinguish, and shew in what sence faith is not imputed for Righteousness, then flatly and simply to say; It is not, when God saith, it is. Else we shall give the adversary the greatest advantage that he can desire or expect; when he shall shew those words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which we flatly deny: And hereby we shall lay the greatest temptation before the ignorant, that know not how to interpret those Scriptures. And that I have not missed the sence of the Assembly, I am induced to believe, by what that Learned Reverend man Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> who was one of them, hath wrote in Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this controversie against <hi>Saltmarsh Shad. Pag.</hi> 53, 54, 55, 56, 57. to which I wholly subscribe (expounding the word <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as I have declared) And where he shews that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but meerly Verbal, so far is it from being in Fundamental Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where the next words say, <hi>but only as it is an Instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his Righteousness,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> note that they say not that it is an Instrument of Justifying us, so I understand them thus, <hi>as it is the Moral reception of Christ and Righteousness freely given,</hi> improperly called an Instrument: and that they speak of that aptitude in faith, for which it was chosen to this office, supposing its being a condition of the Covenant, or Gift, as its nearest Interest. If I have hit their sence, I assent to this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where it is said, <hi>The word of God is to be Preached only by such as are sufficiently gifted, and also duly approved and called to that office,</hi> I understand it only of that sort of Preaching which is proper to Ministers, believing that there is also a Preaching which a Master may use in his Family, and other Christians occasionally: and herein I doubt not but I hit their sence.</p>
               <p>By the Spirits that I have been haunted with, and the measure that I have received, I am forced to expect, that some should here charge me with taking an occasion to quarrel with the Assembly, or shew my own conceited wisdom, in the correcting of their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118986:39"/> works. But I appeal from unconscionable calumniators, to the righteous Judge. I so highly reverence that Assembly, that I think this Nation, since the Apostles days, had never any that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled it for Piety, and Ability: and I doubt not, but the frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much of their labour lies heavy on some, that yet make light of it. But with such e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vious and censorious persons as I have to deal, I find my self in the case of <hi>Poggius</hi> Countreyman with his Ass (they that would laugh may read the Fable; but I am serious:) I am cast into an impossibility of escaping their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures Should I have professed my Assent, without these explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I should wrong my Conscience. Should I have said nothing of this Catechism, they would have concluded that I dissented in some weighty points, and durst not subscribe it. I considered these, and chose rather to cast my self on the smaller censure, then the greater; hereby manifesting that it is a small matter, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein I dissent.</p>
               <p>The like I must say of the Assemblies Confession of faith: Some have told me, If I be Orthodox, they expect my Assent to that: But without some explications I cannot Assent, which will give the same occasion of censure to these men: and if I wholly pass it by, they will surmise that it is for greater matters that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse. I will therefore in this also venture on the lesser inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, seeing one is become unavoidable.</p>

If I may not be allowed this interpretation, I must herein dissent: and if this Confession was intended for a Test to all that should enter into, or exercise the Ministery, I hope it was never the minde of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Assembly to have shut out such men as Bishop <hi>Ʋsher, Davenant, Hall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> Dr. <hi>Staughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and many more excellent English Divines, as ever this Church enjoyed, who were all for General Redemption, though not for an <hi>equal</hi> general Redemption: to say nothing of the Divines of <hi>France, Breme,</hi> and <hi>Beroline,</hi> and other Forreigners that go this way.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Whereas in chap. 19. and also in the larger Catechism, (which I forgat to mention before) it is expressed that the promise of life upon fulfilling the Law, is still in being; I understand it only, that such a promise is on record still in the Bible, as having been once in force; but I judge it now to be no promise, but to be ceased, <hi>Cessante materia,</hi> the thing made its Condition (perfect obedience) being not only of moral but natural impossibility, as soon as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was once sinful; so that God is not, nor can be now obliged
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118986:40"/> by that promise, and it is now no promise, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part, and the penal or Comminatory part remain still: For we cannot disoblige our selves, though we may, as it were, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Promiser.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where it is said, ch. 21. sect. 7. that <hi>by a positive, moral and perpetual Commandment, binding All men in all Ages, he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath,</hi> I understand it only of a Virtual Obligation, as much as belongs to the Law, as enacted before promulgation, but not of a true actual obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For no Law can bind till it is promulgate; and positives are not promulgated by Nature▪ therefore not to all men in all ages; therefore they bind not all men in all ages.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where it is said ch. 25. sect. 1. that <hi>the Catholike Church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the Elect that have been, are, or shall be, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

For otherwise the Elect are no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, as Elect, before their Calling and union with Christ: As <hi>Amesius Medull.</hi> truly noteth, <hi>Ecclesia est coelus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum,</hi> and is not to be defined <hi>coelus Electorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I understand those words, <hi>which is Invisible,</hi> as distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church as invisible from the Church as visible, and not as expository, as defining the Catholike Church to be so invisible (in respect of Faith) as not to be also visible (in respect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.) For I conceive that Christ hath one Universal Visible Church, called one by the Unity of their profession, though not for any visible Head on earth, whether personal, or collective, Pope or General Council.</p>
               <p>And now I leave to Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> and others to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Jesuite, a Papist, a Socinian, an Arminian, will consent to this copious Confession of the Assembly, with these Expositions or limitations, as I have here done? Or whether they will make all the Assembly to be Papists, Socinians or Arminians? I truly profess, I take the labours of the Assembly, especially these three pieces now mentioned, for the best Book, next my Bible, in my Study: However the Libertines, and other giddy Sectaries of these times have despised them, as if they were childish toyes:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118986:40"/> And though I have read over the exceptions of one <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> against the Assemblies Confession of Faith, which whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads, may see with half an eye that the Author was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. He sets up the main body of Popish Doctrine; only instead of the Popes Supremacy and Infallibility, he draws people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Doctrine from some new inspired Prophets: but if these cheaters could draw people once to receive the Doctrine, it were easie to disgrace those pretended Prophets, and to take them down out of the chair at their pleasure, and so set up the Pope again.</p>

               <p>6. I Have perused over all the Articles or Decrees of the<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and unfeignedly▪ honour them, as containing sound and moderate Doctrine, and heartily lament that some late Divines have to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church and Truth, forsaken the moderate way of that Synod, and laid the weight of the Anti-Arminian Cause, so much upon higher points not owned by them. And there is nothing that I have observed in it all, that my Judgement doth contradict, if I be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these few Expositions following.</p>
               <p>VVHere it is said Artic. 1. Sect. 12. <hi>De hâc aeterna electione, electi suo tempore variis licet gradibus, &amp; dispari men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura, certiores redduntur, non arcana, &amp;c.</hi> I understand it as shewing only what way the Elect do attain assurance, who more or less do attain it, and not as affirming that all the Elect do more or less attain a certainty of their Election. For as I think that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine uncomfortable to many poor Christians, so I think it cannot he proved of all the Elect.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118986:41"/>2. In the 3. <hi>Art. sect.</hi> 12. its plain by the annexed words, that <hi>persuasionem Moralem,</hi> they mean external swasion, and do not determine whether the name of swasion be agreeable or not, to the internal work of the Spirit, which for my part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> am certain is beyond my reach to know, and I am confident beyond the reach of all men on earth, even those that most pretend to know it. But that this grace of the Spirit is necessary to sanctifie both the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Will, and that it is an act of Omnipotency, and infallibly effectual, (commonly called irresistible) on all the Elect, I am ready against all Pelagians to defend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where it is said <hi>sect.</hi> 15. that <hi>Qui illam non accipit, is aut haec spiritualia omnino non Curat, &amp; in suo sibi placet: aut securus se habere inaniter gloriatur, quod non habet:</hi> I understand it as spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ordinary sort of graceless unregenerate men, and not of all; for I doubt not, but its possible for a wicked man to know that he is wicked, and be afraid of Hell, yea, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair. I am loth to think desparation is a mark of Grace, and that none are graceless but the secure and confident.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the 5. <hi>Artic. sect.</hi> 9, 10. Where it is said that▪ <hi>Believers may be, and are certain of their perseverance, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their faith,</hi> I understand that word, <hi>are Certain, pro men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura fidei.</hi> 1. As supposing the certainty of their sincerity; for a man must be certain that he hath grace, before he can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to persevere in it. 2. As supposing a certain understanding of the Truth of the Doctrine, that all true Believers shall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly persevere: for none can be certain to persevere meerly as a Believer, that is not first certain that all Believers shall persevere. 3. I suppose therefore that this is not spoke of all Believers, but of some. For 1. All are not certain that they are sincere. 2. All are not certain that the doctrine of Infallible perseverance is true; for to conclude that all the Lutheran Churches that deny this, and all the Arminians and Anabaptists that deny it, and all the Ancient Fathers and Churches that denyed it, besides <hi>Musculus,</hi> and others of our own, were certainly graceless and unbelievers, were not only inconsistent with the faith and charity, but with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Christian; and no less then an inhumane charge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where it is said, <hi>sect.</hi> 11. that God <hi>per Spiritum Sanctum perseverantiae certudinem in iisdem rursus excitat.</hi> I understand it as true of some, but not of all; for I dare not pronounce dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118986:41"/> on all that die unassured of their sincerity, much less on all that are unassured of perseverance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To the 13. <hi>sect.</hi> I doubt not but the meaning is, that Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of perseverance doth not of it self, and of its own nature beget carelesness or negligence; and so I believe its true. Nay, I think that Love and Gratitude are ordained to be the Master Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Graces in the Kingdom of Christ (under Faith;) and that Fear is but to supply the defects of our yet-imperfect Love. And therefore the more any man loveth, the more he will obey: and the more he is assured of Gods love, the greater advantage he hath to love him again. But yet I doubt not, but the remnants of our corruption, by the strength of temptation, may make Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance an Occasion, or Accidental Cause of Negligence and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sin: which I suppose this Section doth not deny.</p>
               <p>These are all the limiting Expositions which I desire liberty to make use of, and with which I do, as is aforesaid, profess my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Canons or Decrees of the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> And how far any of these are from favouring Arminianism, they that will see, need not to be ignorant. Yea, in the very Article of perseverance, which some were pleased to quarrel with me about, I subscribe to the Synod: Yea, in the Article of the extent of Redemption, wherein I am most suspected and accused (and was fain to use a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting<note place="margin">☜</note> Exposition in my consent to our Assemblies Confession of Faith) I do subscribe to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, limitation, or exposition of any word as doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. I do also freely consent to the Rejections, with the liberty of three or four the like Explications, which I will not mention, lest I seem quarrelsom, or be further tedious, because they are about smaller matters then those I have mentioned, and no way touching the quick of the controverted Articles, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that my sense of them is the same with the Synods.</p>
               <p>And because it is this Synod purposely called against Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, that is the best discovery what is to be accounted Arminian or Anti-Arminian doctrine, as I think, by consenting to it, I do clear my self from that calumny with all men of Conscience and Reason that know it, so I shall think that those who go as much on the other hand, and differ from the Synod one way, as much as<note place="margin">☜</note> the Arminians did the other way, remain censurable as well as they; till some body shall convince me that there is but one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118986:42"/> in this case, and that a man may hold what he will without danger, so he be but sure it go far enough from Arminianism. A man that holds to the moderation of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> need not say that Christ did not dye or satisfie for all men, nor need he trouble himself with presumptuous Determinations about many Mysteries in the Decrees of God, which many volumes are guilty of; Nor doth he need to aver the Necessity of Immediate Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Efficient predetermination by God (as the first cause) of every second cause Natural and Free, as without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act: Nor need he say, that God so predetermineth to the Act which is sin, and not to the sinfulness of the Act: Nor need he Subscribe to all that Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> or such like, have written on these points. Nay, as this Synod, so our own As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly gave an Example of modesty in these points, to them that will follow it; Not only silencing many things which others make the Pillars of Anti-Arminianism, but expressing that <hi>the Will is endued by God with that Natural liberty, that is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of Nature determined to do good or evil,</hi> and therefore they never tell you that God as the first cause must of natural necessity Determine mans will by Physical immediate premotion, before it can act either good or evil: But they reserve the honor of determining mans will to special Grace, <hi>Renewing the will, and by Almighty power determining it to that which is good.</hi> c. 10. Sect. 1. and c. 9. Sect. 1.</p>
               <p>Many other moderate passages I could shew in our Assemblies Confession, to some that have need to imitate them, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians may see their Doctrine subverted, in their excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of saving faith, in both Catechisms, and in the Confession; in their determination of the natural effects of sin in whomsoever, <hi>Ch. 6. Sect.</hi> 6. in their determination of the necessity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (as <hi>sine qua non</hi>) to Remission, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15. 3. with more the like.</p>
               <p>And now if they have any standing Rule to know a Papist or Arminian, I think I have acquit my self from their Accusation; But if there be no Rule of the Orthodox Doctrine, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Error, but the giddy distracted brains of Libertines, that know not where to fix themselves, then I am content to bear the name of Jesuit, Papist, or what these men shall please to call me.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:118986:42"/>
               <p>Yet let me add this, lest my seeking to satisfie the offended, may draw me into guilt; Though I have voluntarily my self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed my consent to these several Canons and Confessions of faith; yet, for the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> the Confession of our Assembly; yea, or the larger Catechism, without some Correction, I do hereby Protest my dissent against the so imposing them to a word upon all Ministers, that no man that cannot subscribe to them shall be permitted in the Church: Whether our Confession were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for such a necessary Test, I know not well; But that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> was, is expressed in the end. I abhor unlimited liberty of Conscience, so called, that is, of divulging intollerable Doctrines; and I lament also, that instead of moderation, the Churches for 1300. years have been so guilty of proud and cruel Tyranny. There is singular use for a full body of Theologie, or a Profession concluded on by such Reverend Assemblies, that the yonger Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters may be taught by it, and the Reverence of it may restrain them from rash contradicting it: And there is a necessity of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising power in Ministerial Assemblies, for the actual restraint of such as shall teach things intollerably unsound: and all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should be there accountable for their Doctrine. But before any Forms be tendred us to subscribe, we must have them reduced into a narrower room, and into phrase so clearly Rational or Scriptural, as no Sober, Studious, Competent, Godly Divine shall scruple: Call it Socinian, or what name so ever imperious Faction shall put upon it, yet tender Consciences will expect this, and the Churches shall never have peace in any other way, unless I be a false Prophet; and the contrary course doth but tend to do the same in Doctrine, as the Common-Prayer-Book did in worship; Even to ensnare the most conscientious, and work them out of the Ministry by degrees, and to create us insensibly a lazy formal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that will take all upon trust, and run to the Authority of their confession, instead of their Bible. I have long feared that the toleration threatned in these times for all, is a judgement of God for our running into the Tyrannical extream so long; and I withall hope that he will turn this judgement to a mercy. Though I dislike too much liberty in the Commonwealth more then too little; (and in the Church much more such toleration is intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in cases of clear duty or sin;) Yet, I fear Tyranny more then too much Toleration. 1. For experience sadly tels me that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical <pb n="28" facs="tcp:118986:43"/> Usurpation of dominion over mens faith hath distracted the Church, even beyond any visible probability of recovery; and it hath been the cause of its misery for 1300. years; but the experience of the mischiefs of Toleration is nothing so great. 2. And I know that mans nature is so prone to proud domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so Idolatrously inclined to have all men of their mind, and to dance after their Pipe, that it will be still by assing Rulers to that extream: So that its easie without a spirit of Prophesie to foretell, that unlimited Tolerations will not long be granted by any one except a meer Infidel, that having no Religion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, cares for nothing but his own politick ends; or a <hi>Julian</hi> that is contriving the extirpation of Religion, and intends by the tayling of Foxes to fire the field of Christ, rather then by the yoaking of Oxen to plow and sow it. And policy will never long work that way neither, without some persecution intermixt. Its easie to Prognosticate this, to him that knows what the heart of man is. So that for my part, I think the cause of Gods permission of too much loosness in these times, is to cure our former Rigor, and our being Righteous and Orthodox overmuch, by suffering men to go as much too far into the contrary extreams. Little do some men lay this to heart, who only continue exclamations (though deserved) against Toleration, when it is but their own disease, and what they have caused, that God is curing by this sad remedy. They should rather see their sin in this glass, and be humbled.</p>

               <p>And here I must desire the Reader, that would not wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and me, to difference between <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Words:</hi> and to know, that though fit Terms and Methods be commendable, yet while we agree in the Matter, the difference about meer words should not seem great.

               <p>And first I shall tell you Negatively what I do not give to works: and then Affirmatively what I do: and I shall not hide my mind in either.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I Believe that neither</hi> Adam <hi>in Innocency, nor any Angel, were capable of deserving any thing that was good from God, by way of Commutative Justice, or as making God their Debtor for any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that he received by their works.</hi>

So that Faith in all its parts and respects, is</hi> in natura rei, <hi>fitted to this office: Insomuch that we may in some respect call it, The Law of nature which imposeth Faith on Redeemed man (all the preparations considered and supposed) as well as we may call it the Law of nature which imposed perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on perfect man.</hi>

                  <hi>therefore made the condition, because in its nature it is fitted directly</hi> ad ipsam Remissionem; <hi>It is commanded and appointed to this office, for the</hi> immediate <hi>necessity and fitness of it, to our obtaining pardon as pardon: For it is not Repentance, but Faith, which is the accepting or receiving applying Act or Grace (which is called its Instrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by Divines: and if this concession will satisfie, I should be glad:) But Repentance is made a condition of pardon, on another reason, (though as necessary</hi>) viz. <hi>Because without it God and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer cannot have their end in pardoning us, nor can the Redeemer do all his work, for which we do accept him. For his work is, upon the pardoning of us, to bring us back in heart and life to God, from whom we were fallen and strayed. This was Christs work, to seek and save that which was lost. To be lost, is to lose God. To be saved, is to be brought back to God. Therefore the conditions which Christ maketh are, as if he should say,</hi> If you will be saved by me, and are willing that I shall bring you back to God, I will both bring you into his favor by pardon, and into a capacity of personal pleasing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him. <hi>Now our Repentance is our consent to return to God, and the change of our minds, by turning from former sin that was our Idol, and being willing by Christ to be restored to obedience. Ʋnderstand therefore (as I shall say more anon) that pardon of past sins, is a step to our future Sanctity and Obedience, as one of its ends. Therefore doth Christ pardon what is past, that we may be in a capacity accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to return to God by obodience. And therefore we must first turn to him by Repentance, which is a purpose of obedience, before he will pardon us. For without this he cannot attain the ends of his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. I have Animadversions from a most Judicious Learned Divine, that thinks indeed Repentance and Faith to be all one: and many others are of that mind. In some respect it may be so: but not in all: of which I'le not stand to speak now.</hi>

Yet with a very great difference both in the Reason and the Order of them, which must be carefully marked.

                     </gap>ons merit not pardon or salvation. And for the order, observe it in respect of our first Iustification, and of our continued Iustification, and our sentential Iustification. As to our first Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (which Divines commonly mean alone when they treat of Iustification) Our Remission of sin is only for the Merit of Christ, and in his blood: and I give not saith, or any act of man the least Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnership with Christs Righteousness▪ nor any share in this honour.

Only our own faith and Repentance (without the present existence of external Gospel-works, much more without the works of Mosaical Ceremonies) are Conditions without which God will not pardon or Iustifie any man. The sinner being thus pardoned of free Grace, it being the nature of all Grace to Cooperate and mutually further each other, our after-Holiness and Obedience may well be called one End of our former Iustification and pardon: for Christ did of purpose pardon us, that

And Christ mentioneth them in his description of the Judgement more then faith or Repentance, (perhaps as foreseeing how men would mistake here); because faith is visible and unquestionably implyed in sincere obedience (and so is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance); but obedience is not implyed as existent in faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Obedience is in them but as</hi> in semine, <hi>and in the Cause, but they are in obedience as the life of the tree is in the fruit, or the life of the Root in the ear of wheat, or as the life of the Heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the lively motions and operations of the body.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If any say, It is not proved that there is any Accusation of the Saints at Judgement, or any such particular proceedings in their Justification; I Answ. 1. I am not now proving but confessing my own Judgement. Yet that Satan is the Accuser of the Brethren I know, and that we shall be Iudged according to what we have done in the body, whether it be Good or Evil, and must give an account for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idle word: and Christ will mention feeding or not feeding, cloathing, or not cloathing, visiting, or not visiting, as a Reason of his sentence: And he will call for an account of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular talents, whether one, two, or ten. 2. We do not know how God will manage that Iudgement, further then he hath revealed▪ But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as is most probable, that Christ will dispatch all in a small time, and make no long and delatory work of it, yet if he do but open the eye of Conscience to see all as naked in a moment, he will reveal it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118986:56"/> in the true order of Causes and Effects, Antecedents and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; and how one dependeth on another: This his own description of the Iudgement plainly evinceth; and all this Order can he shew to the soul in one moment. So that they who would from the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness and speed of that Iudgement, or from the perfection of the Saints deliverance by Iustification in this life, argue against this Iudgement, or the rational natural order of its proceeding, that in this Confusion they may hide their mistakes, do in vain contend against the clearest light of Scripture. And they that say we shall not be Iustified in Judgement, but only Declared to be Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied here, do either say consequentially [we shall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] or else [we shall not be Iudged at all,] seeing Iudgement in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is by Iustification or Condemnation in special: and then they deny a main Article of the Creed, that Christ shall come again to Iudge the quick and the dead.

                  <hi>THus I have given the offended part of my brethren a true and full account of my judgement, how much I give to Works, and how much I deny to them in this matter of Justification. Which yet I do with this protestation. 1. That I intend not all this as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of my Creed, or as being all of it of necessity to Salvation to be believed, nor would I obtrude it on others, if I had power, nor is it all of equal moment. 2. That I do not peremptorily fix upon any part of it that is doubtful or controvertible among learned Godly men, so as not to hear any reason against it; but am ready to lay it by, when I can by my utmost industry and Gods illumination procure so much more light as to discern my mistakes. 3. That if there be ever a word in this contrary to that General Creed or Confession which I made in the beginning, or contrary to the Scripture, I do now in the general and implicitely disclaim it; and when I see it particularly, I will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Renounce it, and Correct it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Reasons of my being so large on this Point, are these two. 1. Because Mr.</hi> Crandon <hi>doth so frequently and uncharitably accuse me of subtile reserves, and dissimulation, and hiding the worst, and meaning one thing, when I write another; I have therefore opened my mind to the full, reserving nothing that I can remember, of moment, as to the point in hand, but shewing how much I give to man; Yea, I have studied to say the very utmost for Holiness and Obedience, that was in my thoughts, that they who account this Popery, may see the worst.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Also many do follow me with importunity to Reprint my Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms, whilest others do hold my hands. To satisfie these in the mean time, I have Anticipated much of them in these Conclusions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the summ of what I mean to say on this point more largely (though I be put to repeat much of this again:) Or if God will not let me live to do that work, and publish my thoughts more fully, yet these conclusions have discovered so much of them, as may acquaint men with my meaning in the main, in this point, that they mistake me not so grosly as some formerly have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet I have something more to add: For though this be the summ of my thoughts on this point, as to the matter, and I will not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to contending, with any that agree with me in the thing, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree in words only; and though I verily think that it is most in meer words that I differ from those Reverend brethren who have given me their Animadversions on these points; Yet because even verbal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118986:62"/> mistakes may introduce real, or the Verbal and the Real are not by all discerned asunder, and lest any think I make a greater matter of any terms or Notions of my own, then indeed I do, I will say something of my judgement about the very terms which there is so much strife about in the Churches.</hi>

More specially, such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a Workman doth for his wages, making it Debt, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that may redound thereby to another, by way of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice. 3. Or else for perfect obedience according to the Law of Nature as made to perfect man in innocency 4. Or for the doing of the task of services in <hi>Moses</hi> Law, in themselves consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; which was specially called Works. 1. Because of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, external, endless task of duty which it contained: and 2. Because of the costliness of the Sacrifices, in whose value they much trusted. 3. Because of Gods own institution of them, which (mistaking the end) they the more confided in. 5. For Actions which are conceited Meritorious (when indeed they are not,) though not upon the terms of commutative Justice, yet of distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive. 6. For any action which is done more for anothers good then our own: Either, when men conceit they advantage God, or when they help men. Especially when they are costly actions: as giving to the poor, building Almes-houses, Colledges, Churches, &amp;c. 7. For sincere obedience to the Lord that bought us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gracious terms of the Gospel 8 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the External part of this obedience, distinct from Love, Trust, &amp;c. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there may yet more sences be remembred. Concerning this I lay down these Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> never took Works in the first sence, so as to exclude them from being conditions of Justification: For then he should have excluded Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:118986:62"/>2. Nor did he so take them in the seventh or eighth sence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them from being conditions of our final Justification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>James</hi> took not Works in the same sence as <hi>Paul▪</hi> For the Works that <hi>James</hi> speaks of were necessary, but the Works that <hi>Paul</hi> mentions might not be attempted or imagined, which make the reward to be not of Grace but of debt; and the Works of Jewish Ceremonies cease.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because it is the Scripture Phrase to call Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the name of Works, therefore no man is to be blamed simply for so doing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet is there so great a difference between Gospel-obedience, and both Mosaical Ceremonies, and the perfect fulfilling of the first Law, or any conceited Merits, that we should keep that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as apparent as we can; and therefore not use the term <hi>Works,</hi> (which <hi>Paul</hi> so appropriates to the other sorts) when there is any jealousie whether you mean not one of the other sort of works; unless you explain your self in the use. And therefore ordinarily the terms <hi>Obedience, or Repentance, Love, &amp;c.</hi> are fitter then the term <hi>Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. For though no creature can Merit of God in Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice, yet <hi>Adams</hi> works were, 1. As much in weight and number as God in Justice could require of perfect man. 2. And they were to be more in giving out to the honor of God, and less in direct receiving: though yet he did receive in all. Our works are nothing to what is due for number or weight; and they are all so purely receptive, that though we must aim at Gods Glory, yet it is at the Glorifying of Free-Grace, wherein we are receivers. Faith is the acceptance of Christ and life freely given: Love is but the mode or nature of that acceptance, respecting the goodness of the Object. Repentance is but an emptying our hands of dung, that they may be fit to receive Gold. Lamentation, Humiliation, and open confession of sin, are but proclaimings of the freeness of Grace, and telling God and men how much we are unworthy of it, and deserve the contrary: or else preparations to make our hearts fit to tast and value the freeness of Grace.</p>

Sometime it is taken for some desert by eminent service for the Commonwealth, above what the Law of that Commonwealth imposeth: as <hi>Davids</hi> killing <hi>Goliah;</hi> the acts of his worthies, <hi>Sampsons</hi> exploits, &amp;c. which a Rector, as such, among men, is obliged in Justice to Reward, both for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good thereby advanced, and for encouraging of gallant men. 3. Sometime it is taken for desert by so perfect obedience to the Rector as is very eminent and exemplary, or as perfect as he can require: Such as <hi>Adams</hi> in Paradise should have been. 4. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is taken for an act of meer love, supposed to deserve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of love, though the party beloved receive no benefit by it. 5. Sometime for some eminent expression of that love, as by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing ones life, or losing limbs or life in anothers cause, and for his sake, though he receive no benefit by it. 6. Sometime for very great sufferings or losses sustained in the execution of some commands, which it is supposed deserve some reparation, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from the Commander: as maimed Souldiers deserve to be maintained. 7. Sometime it is improperly taken, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any condition to which a Reward is promised by the Rector, though it advantage him not, and have no proportion to the Reward, and were it self due; yet because the work pleaseth him, as being a thing he loveth, therefore he promiseth the Reward, and upon these two grounds conjunct▪ the vertuousness of the work, and the Obligation of the promise, they call the performance of the condition, Merit: much more, if any of the former concur. 8. Sometime it is taken for any performance of the condition of a Promise or Gift, though the nature of the condition be not so much positively to please, as negatively not to displease. As in a free gift, where naturally among all men these three conditions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118986:63"/> are supposed. 1. That you reject not, nor despise the gift, but accept it. 2. That you be not unthankfull. 3 That you abuse not him that gave it, as to spit in his face, or se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k his dishonor or death. And though the acts may be positive, yet it is rather a not displeasing, then a positive pleasing, which they are required for. 9 Sometime it is taken for any duness of a Benefit or Right to a thing, though by absolute gift, or natural Inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 10. Sometime for a meer comparative worthiness: as when two men, who do neither of them properly deserve well, yet one is far better then the other, and is said to be more deserving then he, that is, less undeserving: Or if one of them must have the benefit, he is the fitter. 11. Sometime for any acquisition. 12. And sometime it is taken <hi>in sensu forensi,</hi> for the Merit of the cause, as to the judgement to be passed. And so Lawyers say that every cause hath Evidence and Merit: and they define Merit, thus, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum causae est in quantum Juri Congruit, quod rectè estimatur ex sententia juris &amp; aequitate,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Zouch</hi> saith. 13. Sometime it is taken for the fitness of any thing in Nature, Art or Morality, to be esteemed and denominated good, according to its Nature. As every good Work, or gracious inclination deserveth to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it is. So he that performeth Christs conditions, deserveth to be esteemed or Judged a performer, and not a non-performer thereof. For every thing is worthy to be judged to be what it is. So Goodness or Amability is called Merit, because every thing deserves to be loved and accepted, so far as it is good and lovely: and consequently to be lovingly used. 14. Lastly, Merit is oft taken in an ill sence, commonly called Demerit, for the desert of some evil.</p>
               <p>Now among all these senses, it is not fair to condemn any man of Error for the bare use of the word, till you know what sence he takes it in. Yet do Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> make me as bad or worse then any Papists, who own not the very word at all, in that whole book, which they write against: But only say, that improperly and largely it maybe thus taken, that is, will bear such a sence.</p>
               <p>All these forementioned sorts of Merit are not properly called Merit. I was about setting down how many of them may be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how many not, in our case, as to the matter, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the propriety of the term Merit. But it would be too long, and you may partly gather it from what is said before, and it is not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118986:64"/> hard to see it in the nature of the thing, for the most of them. And therefore leaving every one to judge of the Matter as they see cause, How far Man hath any of these things, by men called Meritorious? I shall only speak to the very <hi>Word,</hi> according to my intent. And I shall speak my thoughts in these two conclusions following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I do think it unfit to use the term</hi> Merit <hi>of any Actions of man, as to Gods Mercies or Rewards, and that Divines should agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to disuse it, and reject it, and express their minds by some fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Reasons are these. 1. Mans heart is proud enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Instigations: We have more need to contrive all the most effectual convenient means, for the destroying of this most dangerous Master sin: and even to fit the very terms of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to this end. And though the matter that some intend by the term Merit, have no tendency in it self to our puffing up, and we must not disclaim obedience, for fear of being proud of it, yet the term doth so strongly savour of more then any sober Christian may arrogate to himself, that I think it unsafe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if it should not be so to the judicious, yet it is to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who will use the word in imitation of them, when they cannot imitate them in the Caution and Interpretation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Scripture useth this term sparingly (I mean the words of the same signification) if at all; which many learned men do question. And we have great reason to use it as spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In its most proper sence, as it signifieth that which is <hi>Not due; which is to the benefit of another; which hath any proportion to the Reward, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, or but any one of these, it cannot be used by us but with arrogant presumption, and such, as if it be heartily done, is destructive to our Christianity, and inconsistent with since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is not fit therefore ordinarily to use a phrase, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, which is so dangerous in the proper signification. We know how we speak it, but we know not how others will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and receive it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The estate of man since his fall is so depraved and miserable, that it beseems him to speak in answerable language. For the poor to speak proudly, a sinner to use Arrogant terms, is an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unexcusable Error.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:118986:64"/>6. It sounds as a contradiction to the very design of the Gospel. God hath contrived the abasing of man before he glorifie him, and the honoring of Christ and Free-Grace by mans humiliation: and to take men off all conceits and confidence of proper Meriting, before he ever give them a tast of Reconciling Grace. Now to use such arrogant words, how well soever we mean, is to cast a stumbling block in the way of our Brethren, and to make an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of resisting Christ, and sacrilegiously violating the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Glory. All Christs true friends and followers should be tender of his honor, and study the advancement of his blessed ends, especially being so sweetly suited to our Necessities, as the way of Love and Free-Grace is; and not causelesly to run into such foul appearances and occasions of evil.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The very Phrase of Merit (if I may judge of others by my self) hath somewhat in it that is ungrateful, and of a displeasing sound to a Christian ear. I never hear it applyed to mans actions towards God, but me thinks there is something within me that disliketh and abhorreth it. The very work of the spirit of God upon a Christians heart, abasing him in himself, and carrying him out to Christ, hath methinks a Reluctancy against, and a distast of such terms as these, and is offended at them, as the senses at that which doth annoy them. And how unfit and dangerous a course it is, for Ministers to use such words, which sound so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully to every gracious soul, is not hard to Judge. For my own part, it never entered into my thoughts, to my remembrance, to approve either of the term or proper sence, how ever Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> unworthily wrest my words, quite contrary to the most evident sence of them, and the whole scope of the place.</p>
               <p>The Lord and my own Conscience know, that my Iniquities are more before mine eyes, and a greater burden is upon my heart; then will suffer me to trust in any Merits of my own, or once to dream that I have such a thing. And though the desire of my soul is to walk with God, and I have tasted of his unspeakable love in his holy ways, and perceived that there only it is that he will be found, and by all the strivings of his spirit against my flesh, and all the workings of Grace upon any depraved heart, I well perceive how God loveth Holiness, and delighteth in Purity, and faithful obedience, and therefore by the Grace of God, I will never think or speak basely and contemptuously of the image of my Lord▪ to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118986:65"/> gain the reputation of being Orthodox among the most honorable of the sons of men, much less with such as Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Nor will I sin against the Holy Ghost, the Sanctifier of the Church, by sleighting his blessed work; Yet I seriously profess, that among all the temptations of my life, I have felt so little temptation to dream of Merit, or to take any boldness with God upon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the worth of any thing in my self, or to be lifted up before him upon a conceit of my good deservings, that I know not the best work that ever I did in my life, which doth not more humble me then exalt me, when I review it. I am so Conscious that I have nothing but what I received, and that it is God that worketh both to Will and to Do, and that without Christ I can do nothing, and that my best Actions are so lamentably defective and corrupted, that without abundant pardoning Grace in Christ, they will sink me to Hell, that I look with shame and sorrow on the best of my Works: I know my heart hath pride in it as well as others, and too oft do I feel it stirring in respect to the judgement of man, and otherways against God; but should I glory or trust in any Merit of my works, I should even be brutish in contradicting such a Sun of Evidence, and such lively sence of my own heart. May I take leave to open my heart in this point, and to speak what I feel there, and to lay by all my other grounds that while? it is thus with me: When I review any duty or work that ever I did, I feel no conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation accrew to my soul from it, as a work, or in respect to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but meerly Negative: that is, I escape the disquiet and trouble which would follow the contrary: The comfort that I have in this respect is positively none at all: Only I find no reason to discomfort my self for those sins which I never committed, (so far:) Were I a Drunkard, Adulterer, Murderer, &amp;c. I might from the demerit of these expect more sorrow then I have. But yet in other respects I find a positive comfort from Holiness, and Obedience: As conditions of Salvation, they are conditions or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of my positive comforts; but not the cause. But as Gods Image, and the things which he loves, <hi>&amp; sub quorum ratione,</hi> he loveth the soul that hath them. (I am loth to say for them, lest it be mistaken,) so I finde them positively comfortable; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me a capable object of his Love. And yet further▪ as they do encline the soul to God, and dispose it to Communion with him, in holy Desires, Prayers, Prayses, in the exercise of Faith, Love,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118986:65"/> Delight, Confidence, Hope, &amp;c. so I finde they are Causes of my Comforts. But I must needs say, that it is far harder to me in these kinds to take half that comfort in my Graces and Duties which I should take, then not to take too much: and I have no need of an Antinomian at my elbow to hinder these consolations, and to say to me, Take heed that you make not Holiness and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Occasion, or cause of your comfort, lest you be a Papist: For I have <hi>Satan</hi> at my elbow, as it were pleading more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, diverting me from that Duty, diminishing the exercise of those Graces, without which God will not be enjoyed, nor my soul maintained in a comfortable frame. To have comfort and spiritual delights in God, from my Graces or Duties in any of these allowable ways, is no such easie matter with me, as that I should need such breath to cool my comforts. I think that were all one, as to say I have need of help to make me less holy, and to destroy my Graces and Communion with God. For the souls Delight and Complacency in God is the height of its Holiness, and the top of all its duties. I do not say that I have no temptation to Carnal confidence in Duties, or that I am not guilty of any such sin; But sure I am, when I take all the helps of consolation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Love of God, the Blood of Christ, the Glory promised, the Evidences of my interest, &amp;c. I have more adoe to reach to the thousandth part of that delight and satisfaction of mind which I should have, then to keep it under.</p>
               <p>And in this my experience answereth my judgement of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of our own Works or Graces in our Comforts. For if we look to the value of them, and the matter of strict Merit, I ever took that which some call Merit to be but▪ <hi>A not Meriting the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>
                  <hi>contrary.</hi> Even <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, had he so continued, had more fitly been said to have not deserved death, then to have <hi>deserved-life.</hi> And they that believe and obey the Redeemer, may be said, <hi>Not to have Merited the loss of Christ and life by a final Rejection of him▪</hi> (though in other respects they might) then <hi>to have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited a part in Christ and life by believing and obeying.</hi> Yet dare I not say that holiness and duty hath no positive interest in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God▪ because it hath none by way of strict merit: Nor dare I think that it is but <hi>Absentia contrarii,</hi> and not to be unholy formally that he expecteth: for so a tree or a stone should please God as well as a Saint. And the state of the glorified Saints
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118986:66"/> would soon confute me. So much against the use of the term <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and in explication and confirmation of the Negative Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. Aff. <hi>Yet where I meet with any sober Oothodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Reasons for this resolution are such, as I dare say, all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, judicious Divines will allow, what ever furious, factious<note place="margin">☞</note> firebrands may imagine of them.</p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The Fathers, and the whole Church of Christ, so far as we are able to judge by their writings, did use the word <hi>merit</hi> (the Latine Writers) or one of like signification (as the Greek Writers did) for above a thousand years after Christ, for ought I finde, without so much as one contradicting voice. And what man that is a Christian doth not so much Reverence those ancient Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, and the whole Church, as to deal tenderly and honorably with them for a word, when they agree with us in sence? And what man that would seem to be a Protestant, dare make all these Fathers, and the whole Primitive Church to be Papists? that hath not a design hereby to set up Popery? For were that true, what sober man would not be strongly tempted to be a Papist?</p>

All our Protestant Divines that vindicate our Doctrine against the Papists, in this point (so far as I can remember) do unanimously endeavor to vindicate the Fathers &amp; first Churches, from Doctrinal Popery herein, and do interpret the term <hi>Merit,</hi> as signifying no more then we confess: and so are tender of the honour of the Fathers and Church.</p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. We have made the terms [<hi>deserving, and merit</hi>] some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what less culpable, by using them familiarly in an improper sence our selves in our common speech. As is plain in the several instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces given, when I opened the divers uses of this word. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; First, <hi>In sensu forensi:</hi> we have so used the term <hi>Meritum Causae,</hi> that it is not very easie to find out another that shall sufficiently supply its place, and be well understood. And we call it <hi>Meritum Causae,</hi> and say, The cause deserves that the person be justified, even in case of a meer fals accusation brought against him; because every thing and cause deserveth to be Judged as it is. 2. In a legall sence, we have used to say, that an obedient subject deserveth protection, and a valiant souldier deserveth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, &amp;c. though perhaps the Prince were never the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118986:67"/> better for them, because the ends of his Government require this. 3. In a domestical Government, we commonly say, when one child is loving, thankfull and obedient to the father, when others are disobedient, and contemn him, that he deserveth the love of the father, and consequently the benefits which are the fruits of that love. 4. In Ethical respect, we are wont to say, that goodness deserves our love. Good actions or good persons, or those that love us, or those that run any great hazzards, or suffered much in love to us, deserve to be loved again. 5. Yea, we give the praise of merit commonly to bruits themselves, for some excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of nature wherein they excel others. Yet there is so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between God and us, that we should be less bold in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>

And how much these are related to merit; and of how neer importance they are to [<hi>merit</hi>] I leave to consideration.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118986:68"/> of the Scripture: But it seems the word <hi>Meritum</hi> hath nothing in it, which should make it much more improper then <hi>Merces:</hi> for they are both Relatives: and they come both from <hi>Mereor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must intreat the judicious Reader not to mistake my end in all this, nor to suppose me to conclude contrary to my former Proposition. I stand between two extreams, and therefore must speak against both. I onely hence conclude, that therefore we should not too much quarrell about the bare word, when we agree in sence: nor should we censure any for the bare use of the word <hi>Merit,</hi> as erring in Doctrine, when it seems to him to be a term warranted by Scripture: But yet where Scripture it self useth a term improperly, we should in our disputes lay by such terms usually, if we have more proper; and where use hath made a term dangerous to the souls of men, it may be fit to forbear it, without necessity, or explication. I have said the more also of this, that it may appear to all impartial Readers, on what grounds, and with what Truth and Modesty Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> charge me with Error, and flat Popery; because that when I was speaking against Merit, I yielded that improperly, and in a larger sence, as Promise is an Obligation, and the thing promised is called Debt or Due, so the performers of the Condition are called worthy▪ and their performance Merit, though properly it is all of Grace and not of Debt. I appeal to any competent Judge, whether these men do not hereby make all the Fathers and Churches of Christ to be Papists, till about <hi>Islebius</hi> his daies; or at least for above 1000. years after Christ (and I think between that and <hi>Luthers</hi> time, the doctrine of Merits was not much decayed)? Yea, some will doubt whether they make not Christ and his Apostles Papists? and then no wonder if they make <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> and all the Protestants that subscribed the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confession, to be Papists: yea, <hi>Bucer, Calvin,</hi> and many of the most eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of his Judgement, who also subscribed, and offered to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the same Confession. I had as live be a Papist with all these, as an Antinomian, calling my self a Protestant. And I think I have said enough to manifest that the Spirit of these two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns writings, is not so like the Spirit of Christ, that covereth his peoples fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Will adde these two things concerning the Matter of Merit,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> having said all this about the Name. 1. All the duties and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Believer are so far from meriting of God properly, and according to Commutative Justice, as we did God any good by it which should oblige him to a Retribution, that they do oblige us much more to God then we were before. For that which is a duty in one respect, and a grace in another, is indeed a choice part of our mercy; and the more we do for God, the more we receive; not only by way of Reward, but in the very Duty: nay Doing it self is but in some respect a receiving from God, and in some respect, a means to further Receiving. When ever the soul is moved to Love, Humility, Thankfulness, Desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it receives this grace, and a pretious mercy it is: and in the exercise it receiveth more: To Love God is some degree of enjoying him: Even to give all we have for him at his Call, is a receiving from him. Honest hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do understand this mysterie, though Hypocrites and Pharisees do not.</p>
               <p>2. Though I say that no Angel is capable of such proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of God, yet I do not intend, that sinful man can merit as far as Angels or <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency might have been said to do: No nor that our working now, is in the main parts, of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as <hi>Adams</hi> then was. His was, <hi>the perfect obedience of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature, from the power of nature and that Grace which was</hi> without proper Merit, <hi>for the continuance of that perfection, and the attainment of more.</hi> Ours is <hi>the imperfect Obedience of a sinner freely pardoned upon his believing and repenting, which obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience mainly consisteth in the Accepting of mercy, and using it for Recovery, and it is performed and accepted by Gospel grace, which is</hi> against <hi>or</hi> contrary <hi>to</hi> merit, <hi>and not only</hi> without it. I will explain all by this familiar comparison. A Father hath one son at full age, who having the full use of Reason and strength, is able and fit to do him answerable service. He will give the inheritance to this son, because he is a son, out of meer Paternal Love, and not of merit of the son: yet because he is an honest vertuous man, he loveth not his son as a son so dearly, but that he would reject him if he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118986:69"/> were a wicked, rebellious son, such as God commanded the Jews themselves to put to death: And therefore he requireth his son to walk obediently and lovingly, as the son of such a Father should do, and not dishonour him, and then he will of fatherly love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on him the inheritance; but if he will not, he will disinherit him. Here the merit of the inheritance is no proper merit, but a Not-meriting to be deprived of it: but Rebellion is a proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that privation. Yet the nature of the work, which is the condition, is answerable to the Age and parts of the son. Suppose the same father hath other sons, that be some of them little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that can but go, and some sick in bed of hurts that they have catcht by their own folly, by falls, or burns, or cut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing them, or the like: or suppose it possible that the forementioned son should fall back into such an infant condition upon his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? Here now the Father hath Commands, Promises of Reward, with conditions and threatenings as well as to the other, but of a far different nature. For here the Father saith to the sick or wounded Child, <hi>If thou wilt take this medicine, though it be bett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r for thy own cure, I will love thee, and I will give thee this or that;</hi> and for prevention of more hurt, <hi>If you will not cut you, or fall, or burn you with the fire, or the like, I will do this or that for you.</hi> Our <hi>meriting</hi> at Gods hands is no more properly called <hi>Merit,</hi> then this of the child by taking meat or medicine offered to cure its own sores, and by taking heed of fire, and what else may endanger hereafter: and in some respects it is yet less then this.</p>
               <p>But I perceive I have stood very long upon this term <hi>merit</hi> (the rather because the Accuser fastneth so much upon it) I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispatch what I have to say to the rest, with more brevity.</p>

               <p>3. THe third term that I would have explained, is, <hi>Worthy</hi> or <hi>Worthiness,</hi> concerning which, my meaning may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what is said in the last.

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>d Obedient Christians are worthy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118986:70"/> of eternal life, and that we must believe and obey, that we may be accounted worthy, and that there is a certain Evangelical worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods Love, and so of the Reward, which consisteth in our sincere Faith and obedience. For this is plain Scripture.</p>
               <p>2. But yet though Christ speak of such a worthiness, because the phrase is improper we should use it sparingly, and alwayes either avoid it, or explain it, where there is danger either of hardening the erroneous, or of offending the weak, by the incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous use of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same I say of the term <hi>Reward;</hi> 1. It is lawful to use it, because Christ doth it so oft: and indeed some more necessity of using this, then either of the former. 2. But yet it must be used with Caution and Explication, for the foresaid reasons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But there is no word that we have made more quarrelling about in this business, then the terms <hi>Righteous, Righteousness, and Justification,</hi> even when we were agreed about the matter. It is inconsistent with my intended brevity, now to mention the divers significations, and uses of these words: Only in brief I shall lay down my thoughts, as far as is requisite to our present purpose, in these Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 1. I do not in these disputes about the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Believers, take the word for that particular vertue, which is usually said to be a Constant and Perpetual Will of giving every man his due: But sometime materially for the Observation of the Laws: And most usually Relatively for <hi>Non-reatus,</hi> not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness, either as to the <hi>Reatus Culpae vel poenae,</hi> in a legal and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 2. It is not only agreeable to Scripture, and so warrantable to call men <hi>Righteous,</hi> because of their own Faith, Repentance and sincere Obedience, but also so frequently done in Scripture, and on such weighty grounds, that this phrase is to be used ordinarily by Christians, and not disowned or avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 3. Yet where-ever any men are called righteous, because of their own holyness and obedience, it still suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pardon of all their sin in the blood of Christ, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ordinarily, imputed righteousness: and this as supereminent above the other, as to their Justification, as I have before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:118986:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 4. It is the Scripture phrase, and therefore war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to say, that <hi>By our words we shall be Justified, and by your words me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shall be condemned. And that men shall be judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works: (And to judge, is to justifie or condemn) And that a man is justified by his works, and not by Faith only; Jam.</hi> 2. 24. I am not now speaking of the sense of these texts, but of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of this langauage, as being used by the Holy-Ghost. None therefore is to be charged with error, for the meer use of the words, unless it be proved that he useth them in an ill sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 5. Yet, though it be Scripture phrase, it should be used with great Caution; and the very phrase of <hi>Justification by Works,</hi> should be avoided or explained, where it may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of drawing men to ascribe too much to their works, or of offence to the godly: and we should more frequently use <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, (which is not contrary to this) and say, that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, without the works of the Law. All things are not convenient, that in themselves are lawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition</hi> 6. I had rather my self use this phrase, <hi>We shall be finally justified, if we believe and sincerely obey;</hi> which is all one as to say, <hi>Faith and sincere Obedience are Conditions of our final Justification:</hi> then this phrase, <hi>We are justified by works, and not by Faith only,</hi> for the foresaid reasons. And if I understand that the latter phrase. though it be the Holy-Ghosts, is offensive, I will avoid it: so be it I may have leave on necessary occasion to use these three phrases, which all our Divines, so far as I know, do allow.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That sincere Obedience is a Condition of our final absolution in Judgement▪ and of the Continuance of our Justification here:</hi> Or if the term <hi>Condition,</hi> and <hi>Continuing</hi> be offensive (though me thinks they should not) I would consent to disuse them both (except when by dispute we are driven to debate the Case, whether they may be used or no, or when I am urged to express what phrases I judge most proper.) Instead of <hi>Continuance of Justification,</hi> I would as willingly say, It is the Condition of <hi>not-losing our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> and instead of calling it a Condition, I am content to use the very words of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cripture, and say, <hi>If we confess our sins, he is Faithful and just to forgive;</hi> and <hi>if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you, but if ye forgive not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:118986:71"/>
               <p>The second phrase that I would have liberty to use, is, <hi>Our faith and sincere Obedience do themselves make us Righteous, our sins being freely pardoned in the blood of Christ:</hi> All our Divines Confess an Inherent Righteousness. A Righteousness which will not so far make Righteous, is a most palpable contradiction; with me, its one thing to <hi>Justifie Constitutive</hi> (which goes before all kind of sentential Justification) and <hi>to make Righteous:</hi> seeing therefore I have their good leave to say, that faith it self and obedience, do make or constitute us Righteous, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 7. The word Justification is usually by many Divines taken only for Gods first Remission of sin at our Conversation, and his then Accepting us as Righteous: And when we dispute with men that do and will understand the word <hi>Justifie</hi> in no larger sense then so, we must needs grant them, that (according to that sense) we are not justified by any Positive works of external obedience; no, nor by any act (or habit) of faith it self, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the time of the first act till death, but by the very first instantaneous act only; so that in their sense of <hi>Justification,</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen I had written this far, I received Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> whole book (having before seen the Monster, <hi>sine Capite &amp; Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dâ</hi>) when I opened it, I found such a name written in its fore-head, as I had thought that dunghill deserved not to be blest with, <hi>viz▪</hi> Mr. <hi>Joseph Caryl,</hi> with his Epistle perfixt. His name in whom I trust, and whose Truth is dearer to me, then the esteem of man, even Jesus Christ, is above all names: and none have names so honorable, as to disgrace his Truth and Wisdom, with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wisdom, by setting those names in the ballance against
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118986:72"/> that Truth. As Gods Truth and Grace is it that makes mens names to be honourable and pretious with his people, so that if they do but stumble and fall upon that Truth, it will break their names in pleces; but if it fall upon them (while they strive against it) it will grind those names to powder. Which I speak not as censuring the name of this Reverend man▪ but as one reason of my security of the Cause of God, what names soever shall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance its opposers. Yet I confess I more envy Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> Errors the honour of this prefixed name, then of all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; or then I envy this Reverend name, the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prefixed to such a volume. I have received a Description from pious fame, of the soul of Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> so unlike to the soul of this Ranting Disputation, that I hereby do crave of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian posterity, that when we are all in our graves, and another world, they would not so wrong this excellent Man, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them to be of kin, because of this connexion. If you say, <hi>He hath given us just occasion so to think;</hi> I desire you both to look upon his disowning the <hi>personal reflexions,</hi> which are the beginning, middle, end, if not all; and also to consider, that the most peaceable dispositions are usually most tractable; and you know not what importunity might have done with your selves: I mean not of such a Comet as Mr. <hi>Crandon,</hi> but of the higher and more illustrious Planets of our Orbe. Learned and pious men, must love and honour the pious and Learned: and therefore their Temptations have the greater advantage. Nor do I in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>east suspect that this godly man hath done any thing against his Conscience, to please others; though perhaps he might be the more neglective of his own name, and might do that which of himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he would have Judged inconvenient; as the <hi>sad Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Theological wars,</hi> mentioned in the beginning, and the <hi>little check to his thoughts, in giving an explicite Testimony to the work,</hi> mentioned in the middle, may perswade us to conceive. Yet because his approbation of the doctrinall part of Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> discourse, and that in the particulars mentioned, do signifie that he is of his Judgement in these Doctrinals, and that he is offended at my doctrine in those points, I do unfeignedly profess to bear so much Reverence to the name of Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> that I take it for my duty to tender him satisfaction in the points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in▪ I have given him offence.

His words which call me to it, are these, <hi>It is a duty to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and <hi>yet the Doctrinall points therein maintained and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, The present freedom of Believers from the curse of the Law, and their free Justification by faith without works, yea without faith as it is a work, through the alone satisfaction of Jesus Christ, are of such moment, and so fundamental in Religion, for the comfort of poor souls, that I cannot but Judge any Essay tending to the clearing of them, much more this large and elaborate discourse, profitable for the Church of God, and worthy of the publick view.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I shall do for the satisfaction of this Pious Man, is, 1. To Declare whether I do indeed deny free Justification by faith without works, yea without faith as it is a work, through the alone satisfaction of Jesus Christ. 2. To Declare how far I deny or maintain the present freedom of Believers, from the curse of the Law. And consequently, whether I deny the faith once given to the Saints, or any thing Fundamentall in Religion, for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans comfort: and whether Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> may be said to have vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated these Fundamentals from my opposition. 3. I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to give a few Reasons (though contrary to my former inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) which perswade me to think that Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> hath not vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated these Fundamentals, and that his discourse is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Church of God, nor worthy the publick view, either because it is large and elaborate, or because it tendeth to the clearing of the truth.</p>
            <p>1. For the first of these, I have spoke my thoughts already, as my mind did then dictate to my Pen: and because I am so far from dissembling my Religion, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> most confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118986:73"/> me to do, that it very much grieveth me, (next the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my own understanding, and my defectiveness in embracing and improving those truths which I know) that I cannot tell how to make men fully understand my mind, and see the best and worst of my thoughts, in matters of Religion; I shall add a few more words, though no more in sence, as being for matter a Repetition of what is said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 1. I have ever held, and do hold, that at our first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, we are Actually and Absolutely justified from all our sins, without exceptions, by faith in Christ, without the works of the Law, or without works in <hi>Pauls</hi> sence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2. I have ever held that faith it self, as a work, in <hi>Pauls</hi> sence, hath no hand in our Justification, nor salvation; much less is it the cause thereof, <hi>quâ opus,</hi> as such a work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 3. I have ever held to this moment, that even those positive works of external obedience to Christ, which all that live after their first believing must perform, or perish, are not so much as conditions of our first Actuall Justification, no nor exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent till after it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 4. I have ever understood most of our Divines, when they speak of Justification by faith alone, to mean by Justification, Gods first putting us into a justified and pardoned estate, upon our first believing. And if so, either I give no more to works to our Justification then they, or else I know not my own thoughts. I say therefore as they use to do, <hi>Bona opera sequuntur Justificatum non precedunt Justificandum,</hi> and therefore they cannot Justifie. Which Reason can hold of Iustification in no other sence then this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 5. I ever thought that it is no Merit or Dignity, or value of mans works, or his faith either, which is the least Cause of his Justification in the last Judgement, or the continuance of his Justification here; much less of his first being justified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 6. I do not believe that man is any way, by any act of faith or obedience, any true cause of Gods pardoning or justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: principal or instrumentall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 7. I never went about to give works or duty, any part of that interest in our Iustification, which our Divines do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently give to faith; <hi>viz.</hi> to be the instrument of our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For indeed I deny so high an honor to both.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:118986:73"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 8. Much less dare I admit the least thought into my soul, of giving the least part of Christs honour or office, either to faith or works, so far as I am able to discern it; nor did I ever feel a desire in my soul so to do: for though I know I have in me the seed of all sin; yet it is no wonder if this sin be so far suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as not to act sensibly, when both Christs interest and mine own do lye so full against it. And if any Brother will manifest that I have given the least of Christs honour or office to mans works or faith, in word or writing, I protest my self unfeignedly willing to receive his information, and that upon such receipt, I will publickly recant such words, and desire such writings may be committed to the flames.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 9. Nay, one main reason which constraineth me to differ from my Brethren, and to deny that faith is an instrument of Justification, is, because I dare not give so much of Christs honor to man, or any act of mans, as to be an efficient cause of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 10. I conceive therefore that the difference between me and them, is not that I give any more indeed to works then they, but that they give more to faith then I, and consequently to man: and that if I be guilty of levelling or equalling faith, and obedience too much, as some think; it is not by bringing up works too high (to be instruments of Justification as they make faith) but in taking down faith too much, by denying it to be the justifying instrument; and consequently in too much abasing all acts of man, which yet I do not see that I am guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 11. I ever held that it is onely faith, and not works, that is the receiving of Christ, and that faith being the onely receiving Grace, (wherein no meer moral duty or Grace doth participate of its honor or nature) it was therefore by God p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culiarly destinated, or appointed to the office of justifying, as fittest to the glorifying of Free-Grace, and of God-Redeemer therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 12. This faith I difference from Evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as I difference the consent to a mans Soveraignty, from my obeying him as my Soveraign; or the consent to Marriage Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the conjugal fidelity and obedience of a wife to her husband: or the taking a man to be my Captain, from obeying him, or fighting under him: or the taking a man to be my Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, from obeying his counsel, and taking his Medicines: and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118986:74"/> Repentance I take to be to our faith in Christ, as the breaking off from other Suitors and Lovers, and turning the mind to this one, is to Marriage: (though some other differences may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, the word being taken variously.) So that I do no more (as I am accused) comprize all obedience in faith, because I Comprize a Love to the Redeemer, and a Consent to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, then I comprize all Conjugal Obedience and fidelity of a woman to her husband in the Marriage-Covenant or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, because I comprize in it Love to the man, and a Covenant of fidelity and obedience for the future. As I have said, Faith with me, is the Taking of whole Christ, (that is in all those Respects which are Essential to him as he is Redeemer and Saviour) by all those acts of the soul, which are of absolute necessity to the true Reception of such an object: that is, by Assent, Consent, Love to him, Affiance, which also have such further respective diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as I fullyer before expressed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 13. I am very Confident that when <hi>Paul</hi> includes faith, and excludes works, he never meant by Faith any one single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual act, or any one onely sort of act in the strictest Physical sense, calling all the rest Works. And if any man will but tell me what one physical act he will tye Justification to, I will prove to him that he excludeth that faith which God includeth. Our own Divines ordinarily say, that Justifying faith hath three acts, <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Assensus &amp; Fiducia,</hi> And <hi>Velle, Eligere, Consentire, Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> is the principal of all, which is not the same with any one of these. And <hi>fiducia</hi> is more then one it self And that Assent which is but one <hi>in Genere,</hi> is many in particulars, according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truths to be believed to the very essence of Justifying Faith. The Scripture expresly describeth it, as consisting in Assent, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Affiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 14. I am of opinion, that those that take Justifying faith only for one Act <hi>in sensu Physico,</hi> do utterly lose and confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the doctrine of Justification, making it impossible for any man on earth to know which is the justifying faith: Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no word of God to direct them, by confining it to any one act, (without which they can donothing), but also because the soul is so curious a piece in its essence &amp; operations, &amp; so much unacquainted with it self, and so defective in reflex Knowledge, that no man can so discern its acts, as perfectly to distinguish them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118986:74"/> and to say when it is but one act, and when it grows to be two or three in meer physical sense. If you diversifie them by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (which is the known way) yet are there in every object, at least, in the object of Justifying faith, such diversity of parts es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, integral, and of Accidents, and respects, and necessary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, that no man on earth can determine just how these do individuate or physically specifie our acts? As if apprehension of Christ be Justifying faith, as they use to say, passing by the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity and Comprehensiveness of the term <hi>Apprehension,</hi> no man can tell us, whether to apprehend Christ, as God and as man, and as God and man in one person, and as the second person in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as one that hath dyed, and by death satisfyed, and as one that is Risen, ascended, intercedeth, hath power to forgive sins, and as one that by pardoning must save us from Hell, and give us Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say no man can tell just how many physical acts go to this: much less can any prove that all this may be done by one physical act: or can any cull out any one, and say, that is the Justifying object and act, and reject all the rest, as not essentially requisite as well as that.</p>

               <hi>Con.</hi> 15. I think they that should attempt such a business, would horribly abuse the Holy Ghost, and would themselves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what element they are in, speaking as <hi>meri Physici,</hi> when they are treating of moral subjects, both Ethical and Political: and they would be guilty of a base reduction of Gods holy notions and Law-terms, to the most vain Philosophy (which Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> seems to be so zealous against), as well as of confounding Physicks with Ethicks and Politicks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 16. Themselves use to confess, that the Promise, and Christ himself, and the Righteousness of Christ, (if not also Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereby) are the objects of Justifying faith: To which I may truly add, the Veracity of God Revealing, the formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Assent, and the Bounty or Good will of God in Giving, as the object (as it were formal) of Acceptance, beside the several parts of the material objects, and invisible Glory the End, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed fully in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to be as essential as any of the rest. And sure our old Physicks must be renounced before we can assert that but the two or three first objects alone (the Promise, Christ, and his Righteousness) can all be apprehended with any one single physical act, there being divers formal objective reasons.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118986:75"/>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 17. I am bold upon the confidence of the premises to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in my Judgement, those Divines that will single out any one Physical act of the soul, and call that alone by the name of faith, and teach the People that by this only they are Justified, and that whoever looks for Justification by any other Act, but that one, is a Papist, a Jew, an enemy to Christs Righteousness, destroyeth the Gospel and the Foundation of Christian Comfort, I say, such men, in my opinion, do utterly ruine the Comforts, and torture and wrack the souls of poor Christians, whom they pretend to support, yea they drive them to unavoidable desperation, if their doctrine be practised: For it is not possible for any one of these poor Christians to find out which is the single Physical act of faith; and then not finding which is it, they must either look for Justification by other acts with it, and so (say their Teachers) forsake Christ and the Gospel, or else venture upon some one act, which yet they are not sure to be but one. Here's comfortable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel doctrine indeed! or if it were granted that philosophical brains can so punctually individuate or specifie their acts, yet all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned that cannot, must be damned, as being cast upon an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable necessity of being Jews, Legalists, Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my part, as subtile and profound a Philosopher as Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness hath feigned me to be (that he might rob me of the name of a Christian, by giving me in exchange the name of a subtile Philosopher) I profess, that neither my naturals or spirituals will serve me to cleave all these hairs, and if this were Christs Law, which they feign, <hi>actum esset de me,</hi> I must needs perish: But I again profess, and that with seriousness, that before I will believe such doctrine which gives up souls to desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under pretence of their highest consolations, and which casteth scorn upon Christ and the Gospel under pretence of a zealous vindication of them, I will be yet more prodigal of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with such men▪ of what name and note soever; and I will sooner take them for such scholars as <hi>Festus</hi> took <hi>Paul</hi> for, then I will believe their doctrine, without better evidence then yet I can see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 18. I am as confident, that by confining Justifying faith to any one single Physical act, men will intolerably abase the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith, making it either no humane, <hi>i. e.</hi> moral act, or so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect a one, as God in Scripture doth abhor. If it be only an act
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118986:75"/> of the Intellect, it will not be strictly moral or humane: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect is but the entrance into the soul, and its acts, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of humane acts: If it be only in the will, it will be blind: If both, without affection, it is lifeless, and contrary to that which Scripture describeth, which is Affiance in God, &amp;c. Nor will it be the entire acting of the soul, if it be not the act (as I may call it) of the whole soul, that is, of both facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the affection suited to that object. Besides, that the soul acteth so harmoniously, that all the faculties will certainly concur.</p>
            <p>Yet let none mis-undestand me, as if I charged our Orthodox Divines with this opinion, which I am now speaking against; but I am confessing mine own Judgement, against some particular disputers that have passionately insisted on this point. Sure I am, our late Reverend Assembly are far from it, in their Definitions of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 19. I do firmly believe that he that Receives not Jesus Christ as Jesus Christ, that is, as God and man, as one that hath perfectly Obeyed, Dyed for us, Ransomed us, Rose again, is now in Glory, Lord of all, as our Saviour from Guilt and power of sin, and so as Priest, Prophet and King, as one that will bring us to Glory if we believe; and so as a Benefactour, and as Good, (and therefore to be Received with Gratitude and Love) I say, he that doth not thus Receive Christ, is not a true Christian, nor hath any true Justifying faith, but shall be damned: and that Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith containeth all this in it. And therefore I believe that they who teach men, that some one onely of these acts is Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, and all the rest are works, which if we look for salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Justification by, we fall from Christ, do lead men the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way to desperation and Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con</hi> 20. Yet I think that the whole of this Faith is usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from some one act, (or more, which we commonly comprize in one name) as most frequently from Assent, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Affiance (which is more then one act it self, and comprehendeth both Assent, and Hope, or Expectation) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time from Willing or Receiving. But when ever Faith is spoken of as justifying or saving, the other acts are included under the name of one. Yet at other times in Scripture the word faith is taken in a narrower sense; as it is by <hi>James,</hi> and by <hi>Paul,</hi> when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118986:76"/> he distinguisheth it from Hope and Love: For otherwise, we are saved by Hope, and Faith is the substance of things Hoped for, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 21. I think that the Jews Conceit was, that Gods Law delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> was so perfect and excellent, that the Doing of of the works therein prescribed, in a laborious task of Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al observances, and in Costly sacrifices and offerings, did by the Dignity and value of the work, derived from the Dignity of the Law, procure of it self the pardon of all their sins, and their full Acceptance with God, without any sacrifice of a Mediator: and that this is it that <hi>Paul</hi> disputeth against. So that their principal intent was to extol and maintain the perfection and sufficiency of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, as wanting nothing necessary to Justification and felicity, not understanding how Christ was the end of it; and in Conjunction with this consequentially they trusted to the Merits of Legal works. Accordingly I think that <hi>Pauls</hi> scope is both to take down <hi>Moses</hi> Law (especially its necessity and conceited sufficiency), and the Dignity of Legal works (and consequently of any works.) I think therefore that by <hi>Works, Paul</hi> meaneth to exclude only <hi>Merits,</hi> or works which are conceited Meritorious, or which for the worth of the Deed done, should procure pardon and Acceptance with God, without a Mediators blood. And so <hi>Paul</hi> himself describes the works that he speaks against, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. That they are such as make the Reward to be not of Grace, but of Debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 22. Our Divines against the Papists do commonly place the Controversie here, and say, that the Question is, whether we are Justified by Works, that is, by the Merit of Works? making them all one. So Dr. <hi>Fowns, Rivius,</hi> and it is the common voice. <hi>Vid. Melanct. Loc. Com.</hi> p. 427, 429. and <hi>Exam.</hi> p. 689. <hi>&amp; 699 &amp; Sotinium Thes. c. 14. §. 6. &amp; 12 Joh. Crocius de Justific. Dis. 12. passim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 23. I do not think therefore, that under the name <hi>Works, Paul</hi> doth exclude the acts of faith before mentioned, the Love of Christ, or Thankfulness for Grace, or the Confession of our great unworthyness, and our extolling the Freeness of Grace, or our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Merits, or our owning the true God for our only God, &amp;c. I say, these acts considered, not as falsly Conceited Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but as Means to Life, (and some of them to Justification
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118986:76"/> at first) and Conditions without which God will not save us, were never excluded by <hi>Paul</hi> among works. Nay, though some of these do not exist till we are justified, yet did not <hi>Paul</hi> intend them as Works in his exclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 24. I presume to confess it my opinion, that those Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren who say, Faith justifieth <hi>quà Instrumentum,</hi> as a true instrument, do most certainly make it to justifie as an Action of man: and that in saying, that <hi>It justifieth as an Instrument, and it justifieth not as an Act, or by Action,</hi> they do speak most gross contradiction: seeing that <hi>Instrumentum est Causa efficiens, &amp; Actio est efficientis Causalitas.</hi> I do therefore say, as well as Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> that Faith it self justifieth not as a Work: And I say more then is commonly said (from whence is the indignation) that it justifieth not as an Action of man neither, and so not as a true proper instrument of Justification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 25. Nay, I will yet say more (and have still said it) that the formal or nearest Reason of faiths interest in Justification, commonly expressed by <hi>quatenus,</hi> is not any Ethical consideration or respect in Faith. This is in the midst between the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I before Concluded, that it justifieth not <hi>qua opus,</hi> as a work is taken for Mercenary or Meritorious working, as a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth for his wages, as <hi>Paul</hi> means: 2. And that it justifieth not <hi>qua opus,</hi> as a work is taken physically, for an act of man. And thirdly I now add, that it justifieth not <hi>qua opus,</hi> as a work is taken for a Moral Vertue, Pleasing to God, because a Vertue: 4. Nay, nor <hi>qua hoc opus,</hi> as it is a work of singular worth or Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to this office. But it is meerly in its Civil or Law Relation (if I may so call it) that is, as it is freely and positively appointed by God to this Office; making it, as he is Donor, the Condition of his free gift; so that it is nothing in the nature of Faith, but the Will of the Donor as such, that in the tenor of his Gift hath given it this Office and Honor: which is meerly extrinsecall to the Nature, or Ethical worth of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 26. I must therefore profess, that after long considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I know no one term that properly expresseth this nearest or formal interest of faith in Justification, but only the term <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as that word is usually taken for the Condition of a free gift. And when the Scripture telleth us, how faith justifieth, it is in such terms as these, <hi>If thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118986:77"/> and believe with thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned:</hi> In all which, if the Conditional <hi>If,</hi> and the conditional form of the Promise express not a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I despair of ever understanding it in this life, though it be the foundation and the summe of the Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 27. Yet though no Ethical worth or Aptitude in faith be the formal Reason of its interest in Justification, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless its immediatly-prerequisite Aptitude for this office and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: And so far as we may give a reason of Gods appointments and will, from any thing without him, in the object, we may say, that therefore God made it the Condition of the Covenant, or of his gift of Christ and Justification, because it was the fittest morall Grace for this work. So that it was some Ethical or Moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or worth in that grace, that caused God (as we may speak) to make it the condition, and so which is its Aptitude to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the remote reason of its interest in Justification; though not the formal and neerest reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 28. Yet even here, it was not the meer Morall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this Grace absolutely, or in it self considered, as a good act; or as better in it self then the Rest: but it was a respective excellency or worth, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is the fittest to this special use and end; as being in its own nature, the believing a word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of unseen felicity, and the accepting of a free Gift, &amp;c. and so fittest for God to design to this office, seeing its his high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in Redemption, to extoll his love and Free-Grace; so that though in reference to meer sanctification, some other Grace might be as good as faith, yet none were so ad-Apt-ed for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. And this I conceive is it which Divines call the instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 29. If any say, that seeing faith hath a peculiar Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to this office, therefore it must have a peculiar Interest; I answer, so it hath. For 1. It doth alone, without (Merits, or) any positive Gospel-works of obedience (as such at least) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (as far as belongs to its office) our first full Justification. 2. The love of Christ received, Gratitude, &amp;c. are but as modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of faith, which is called the receiving it self. Though some of them be distinct Physicall acts, yet all the rest Morally considered, are but as it were the modification of faith, I mean
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118986:77"/> of that act, which is <hi>the acceptance of Christ, and life freely Given.</hi> 3. And for Iustification at Judgement, and the non-amission of it here, faith hath still the principall interest. Repentance (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from faith) and a return to holy obedience, is a Condition upon a remote reason, <hi>propter finem,</hi> but faith directly, <hi>propter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Principale,</hi> which is Christ as our Ransom and Saviour: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is presupposed as a Condition naturally necessary, even as Faith in God alone in opposition to Atheism, Polutheism, and Idolatry, is presupposed as naturally necessary, when we are called to Faith in Christ as the Redeemer: and as the moral Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains naturally necessary, for all the command of special Faith in Christ by the Gospel: But Faith in Christ is an elected condition, elevated to this office above its own nature, by a special Positive Institution and Promise, fitted to its object the Lord Jesus, who is the supernatural and highest means (as Redeemer), and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed also in the Gospel, which is a supernatural Revelation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides as the natural necessity of the moral Law, of loving God, and repenting, and returning to him, are supposed, but these could neither be of any sufficiency or efficacy without Christ the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural way to the Father; nor could the said Love and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance have been wrought without Christ, if they had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: So though they are necessary, yet are they insufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in Christ, as well as impossible (or beyond our power) so that Faith in Christ is that part of the Condition, which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next the head, gives life unto the rest; and though as <hi>sine qua non,</hi> they are of equal necessity with Faith, yet as <hi>cum qua,</hi> or as to the sufficiency of the condition <hi>sine qua non,</hi> so Faith hath not only a precedency, but is as the master-pipe, which being next the cistern, conveyeth all the water into the more remote. This I adde to what I said before against the charge of Levelling Faith and Repentance; Though the Charge of equalling Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is easier avoided: For the Scripture doth expresly make Repentance some Condition, even of our first pardon and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but so it doth not Actual Obedience to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclu.</hi> 30. If after all this, I am not so happy as to hit the true or full reason of the difference between Faith, Repentance, and Obedience, in the point of Conditionality, I solemnly profess it is not out of any desire to equal them: Nay, that I have stretcht my brains to the utmost that I was able, to discover from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118986:78"/> Gods Word the widest difference that I could possibly finde, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desiring (for to avoid offence, and to help me in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pauls</hi> Exclusion of works) to have found the difference yet wider then I have done: And if I see not all, it is for want of Light, more then of Will or Diligence. And I shall heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to see the difference more clearly stated by my brethren <note n="*" place="margin">I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from sober men, that they do cleer up the difference better themselves, or tell us where we may find it done, when they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves offended at the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of my endeavours.</note>; But I dare not in the mean time feign a difference in contradiction to Scripture, or addition to it; by saying that Repentance is no Condition, or that Faith is a proper Instrumental, efficient cause of Justifying or pardoning us: though I have professed not to contend with any that call it an Instrument of our Receiving Christ (if they will suffer me to use the phrases which I think more Scriptural and proper.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 31. I confess that there is such a thing as may be called Justification <hi>in foro Conscientiae:</hi> and that Faith may be called ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Instrument, or some efficient Cause of that Justification: (will not this satisfie Mr. <hi>Crandon?</hi>) But I think that this is none of that which Scripture calls Justification by Faith, nor that it is the same Faith by which we are Justified, which is the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable Instrument or Cause of that Justification by conscience (though that also be a cause of it): but it is that discerning of our interest in Christ and Gods favour through him which is less properly called Faith, and more properly a discerning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Assurance or perswasion of Gods Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 32. I gladly confess also, that Christ made full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God for our sin, and therein intended only and infallibly the actual salvation and Justification of his Elect: And that we may be said to be reconciled to God, and our sins done away, in a diminutive sense as to actual pardon and Reconciliation, even presently upon Christs death and Resurrection, and so before we were born or believed. And if any will call this a Potential or Virtual Justification, though I will not imitate them, because I will keep close to Scripture-terms, yet if they explain their meanings, I will not contend for the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 33. I confess also that God did eternally elect a certain number of determinate individual persons, to be infallibly justified and saved by Christ, in time: And that these were given to Christ that he should dye for them, and for them only with a specialinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actually justifying and saving them: and that all that are so
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118986:78"/> given him shall come to him, and none shall take them out of his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 34. I believe that none can come to Christ except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw them, and that he converteth them by an infallibly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual grace, such as is an act of Omnipotency, and is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, so far as to be overcome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con.</hi> 35. I am certain that the new nature of every Christian containeth a sense of his own great unworthyness, yea his desert of death for the sin of his best duties and such a sense of the Riches of Gods Love and free Grace in Christ, and how much we are beholden to him; that every such soul must needs be prone to disclaim confidence in any thing of their own, and to give all the glory to Christ, and free Grace: self-denyal and ascribing to free Grace, being the most of our Christianity. So that if the zeal of this truth do make the inconsiderate to forget the nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of holyness, and its due place, and to forget how much the Righteous Lord loveth righteousness, and how Christ intended it in his death and Covenant, considering mans frailty, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And supposing that this is Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> case, I heartily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his volumn of calumnies, and railing Accusations: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parswaded he intended them much for Christ, though I think that there was too much of the interest of his private opinion, that made him, as it were, call for fire from heaven, and that he little knew what Spirit he was of. The Lord cause him to know it, and forgive him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 2. I have before declared, that I do confess that God hath by his eternal Decree, Immutably determined to free all his Elect (not yet Believers) from the curse of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 3. I have also declared that I maintain that Christ purged away their sins, <hi>quoad meritum vel satisfactionem,</hi> that is, hath perfectly satisfied and merited their freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 4. I believe that all men are freed from the necessity of perishing (by suffering what they deserved,) as remediless. And that no man that ever heard the Gospel (at least) doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for want of a ransom, or expiatory sacrifice, or a Christ to dye for him, but for want of Faith or a Will to accept a Christ freely offered him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 5. I believe that the Law of Works stands not now as it did to <hi>Adam,</hi> as the sole Law in force, but that the Promissory
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118986:79"/> part of it is void, God being, as we may say, disobliged upon mans sin, and man made utterly uncapable of being the subject to whom such a Promise can stand in force: And therefore that it is fitter to say the Covenant of Works is null and void, because it is from the promissory part that the whole was called (if ever so called) a Covenant. (In this point I retract what I delivered in my Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms.) Yea the Law it self hath received so many extrinsick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, as in its use, its Administrator, &amp;c. that I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with any about the name, whether it should be called the same or another, as long as we agree of the degree and matter of Change. But the great change is, that it hath now a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Law conjunct, when before it stood alone, and its obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had no remedy known. Then perfect obedience was the only Condition of Life; now its neither the sole, nor any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all. For where the Promise it self is ceased, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 6. I believe that by the new Law of Grace, or the Promise, God hath delivered all men (in the Tenor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, though the promulgation reach not to all) from the guilt of sin, as to the destructive punishment, on condition they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Christ and Life; and that no man is excepted out of this Promise (till they remedilesly reject it), but it is so general, that whoever will have Christ, may have him, (on his terms): Though none <hi>will</hi> have him, till Gods special effectual Grace do make them willing. Yet whoever <hi>will,</hi> is called to drink of the water of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 7. I believe that this Promise of deliverance to All, is so free, that no price is required of any to procure it: It is but the Acceptance of a free Gift. And therefore no wonder if Christ be said to have taken away the sins of the world, or if God were said to pardon them, when God hath as far as belongeth to him (I say not, as much as belongs to him absolutely and in all respects, but) as the free Donor by Promise, <hi>per Legem Remediantem,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them; and the stop is only in their not consenting or acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting: and when among men consent is so naturally implyed, that (though it be a true Condition, yet) it is seldom used to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; but where consent only is the Condition of a Gift, it is used to be put in absolute terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 8. I fully believe that as soon as ever any soul hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118986:80"/> Faith, that is, Accepteth of Christ and life as offered, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all sin is pardoned actually, which before was pardoned but conditionally, and that their pardon, as to the present time, is not now Conditional, but as Absolute (the Condition being p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 9. In this Remission God doth Accept them as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into his favour, and discharge them from all guilt of eternal punishment, and of all Destructive punishment in this Life; yea, from all that is not retained for, and sanctified to a greater good then the evil comes to: having promised them that all shall work together for good to them that love God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>

                  </note> who have blazed abroad such calumnies, and jealousies of me, for this one word, (in another Book) have the patience to bear it, I will repeat again to them the same Doctrine, (for I am far from recanting it) <hi>viz. It is my strong opinion, and I am confident of it, that no Justified-Sanctified person, shall ever lose his Justification or all his sanctification, and that God hath promised to cause them to persevere, and to perform the Conditions of pardon for the future, that they may infallibly be pardoned. And I am yet more strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded and confident that God hath promised all this concerning his Elect.</hi> Yet for this very Doctrine, and these terms, have zealous, Godly, tender conscienc't Divines given out, that I wrote against perseverance, yea and have so muttered abroad that my writings are dangerous, that poor Christians are deterred from using them, yea they have engaged some in trouble of conscience not to read that Book, as containing very dangerous matter; with which deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I am well content, if Christ approve of it, and conscience at last find comfort in it (if they look to find any comfort in their works, and such works) and if Satan gain no more by it then I lose, and if it be no loss to those that need them, (as I think in this bookish age it cannot be much.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 11. I believe that when ever the Justified do commit any sin, they have a present and effectual certain remedy at hand for their pardon, that is, the merit of Christs blood, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, the Love of God, the promise of pardon, in which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118986:80"/> they have interest, and the Spirit to excite them to Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 12. I believe that the Mosaical Law, so far as Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is ceased or abrogated, Christ being come, who is the end of that Law: (and this Law is it that <hi>Paul</hi> usually speaks of, in the question about deliverance from the Law.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 13. I believe that no true Christian ought to look on himself, as continuing under Guilt, or unpardoned sin, and bound over to condemnation, or as under the curse of the Law, as it is thus taken: but contrarily, to rejoyce with greatest thankfulness, that God hath freed him by Christ, from this curse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: and to strive against all doubtings of his actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 14. Much less may any Christian suppose himself to be still under the Law of works, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and not under the the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 15. I believe that it is a haynous sin in any Minister to preach the Law of Works, as it stood to <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, to tell men either that they must perfectly obey, as the Condition of their salvation, or that they must merit Life, or that their misery for sin is Remediless, or yet to tell them of the misery, and not of the Remedy. This is to preach as Legalists, and enemies to Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 16. I believe that fears of Hell are not the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and predominant affection in the Kingdom of Grace: But thankfulness for Redemption, and Love to God Redeemer, should be the main motive, even to the wicked, to draw them from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; and especially to the Saints, to keep them to Christ; and that Love is the predominant Ruling-affection, and Fear but to supply in some Cases where Love is defective, and will be while we are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 17. I believe that Humiliation and Brokenness of heart, as it consisteth in humble, self-denyal, and mean thoughts of our selves, must be our constant frame; but as it consisteth in anguish of mind, God delighteth not in it, and useth it only to bring us further, and would not have us stick in it, but hasten to a Life of heavenly delights; and that the Life which hath most thanks, praise, glad obedience, and delight in God, is the life most pleasing to him, and not that which hath most doubt, fear and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:118986:81"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 18. I believe that God doth usually give to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, more or less, some sense of their freedom from the curse of the Law, and of his favour to them, and some peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and joy in the holy-Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 19. I doubt not but a Christian may attain to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his salvation, much more, of his Sanctification and Justification, and that by ordinary means in this life, (though not without the Spirits supernatural help) and that Ministers should with all possible skill and diligence help on Believers to Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Peace and Joy, and not detain them under doubtings and distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 20. I fully believe that the departing souls of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers go to Christ, and the soul and body at the Resurrection shall be publikely justified by Christ in Judgement, and be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from all the fruits of sin for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus I have told you my thoughts, how far Believers are freed from the curse of the Law. If Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> think that I have yet left out any Fundamental, (which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> hath vindicated) yet it may be rather my forgetfulness, then my denying it: I have here set down what suddenly came to my memory, and if I have omitted any part of our freedom from the Curse, I shall be ready to assert it, when I am remembred of it. In the mean time, I hope the charity of my Brethren may reach so far without supererroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as to believe of me that I have no minde to be cursed any more then they; nor have I a mind that any Believer should be cursed: and therefore that it is not any carnal interest or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of the truth that makes me differ, if I do differ, which is more then I know. And if God do but thus far, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, save me from the Curse of the Law, I hope I shall find that I mist none of my Fundamentals.</p>
               <p>I come next to lay down the Affirmatives, How much I give yet to the Law, or how far I take Believers to be under it? And I will promise you, I will contradict nothing of the Negatives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delivered, so far as I can discern. Only I must intreate such Readers as Mr. <hi>Crandon,</hi> to think it possible that I can reconcile my own words when he cannot; and to know, that if by his blind consequences, fetcht from what follows, he will affirm me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all that went before, and make the world believe that I do <hi>in terminis,</hi> or sense, disclaim and oppose the same things which I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118986:81"/> do <hi>in terminis</hi> and sense affirm and defend (as he most immodest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly useth to do), whomsoever else he perswadeth to believe him, he must excuse me, if I credit him but as he deserves.</p>

I do believe that God is our God, King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and that both on the Right of Creation and of Redemption; and that he governeth us by a Law, which is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, that is revealed, by natural causes, or signs, and partly supernatural and Positive: And that this Law doth command us perfect obedience, and determine of each particular wherein it shall consist; and that nothing is sin, but what is against Gods Law, and all that is a breach of it, is sin: and that this Law is <hi>Norma Actionum moralium, &amp; Judicii:</hi> The Rule of our lives, and Gods Judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 2. I believe that this Law doth constitute eternal death, to be the due punishment of every sin, to every sinner: and so obligeth, <hi>ad obedientiam, aut ad poenam;</hi> to obedience absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to punishment in case of disobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 3. I Believe that this Law is not abrogated by Christ, nor did he ever intend such a thing, but contrarily, to attain the ends of it, and satisfie and glorifie the Justice of the Legislator, and so to stablish the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 4. I Believe that this general nature of the Law (to oblige to perfect obedience or to punishment) together with the natural particular precepts in it, are the very Law of nature, that is, resulting from the nature of man in this present station, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the soveraignty and the holy nature of God: so that to say that God himself could change these Laws, otherwise then by first changing the nature or natural station and condition of man, is but to say, he can do contradictories, and can take away a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, while the subject, Term, and Foundation do continue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed should God turn man into a stone, or bruit, the duty of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God would cease: or were it possile that man had a will which should not have <hi>Good</hi> for its object, then God should not be that object.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:118986:82"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclus.</hi> 5. By what names or Titles this Law of God should be called, I resolve not to quarrel about with any, sobeit we be agreed concerning the matter. 1. Some will call it the Covenant of works: which word I used sometime in my Aphorisms, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the name which the whole received from the promissory part. This title upon better consideration, I now think fitter to forbear and disclaim. My reason is (as is said) because the name is given from Gods promise of life in that Law, and that promise is now ceased, and therefore it is not fit to denominate the Law A <hi>Covenant</hi> from that only part which is null. I did acknowledge in my Aphorisms that no man was capable of being justified by this Covenant or promise; but I saw not so clearly as now I do, that the Promise it self is null. (In which point the judicious Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of a very reverend, learned Brother, have been no small help to me, though I am yet forced to dissent in part from his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.) Others stand stiff for what I first in terms asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> The continuation of the whole Covenant, Promise and all: But it is clear, that when man first broke Covenant, God was disobliged: and man was quite uncapable of having such a promise made to him: For when he was once a sinner it was not only, morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that he should be no sinner (as it was impossible for him to keep the Law for the future) but it was naturally impossible, as being a meer contradiction. To feign a promise of God in force, that he will save men on condition they have no sin, when they have all sin already, is absurd. Yet I say not that God abrogated this promise▪ by making a better, but that man nulled it by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant breaking, so making the matter impossible, and so it ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>cessante materià, vel subjecti capacitate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some will yet call this Law in question, <hi>The Law of Works,</hi> though not the Covenant of works: Because the precept and Commination remain (only some Positives ceased which) may well denominate it a Law, and because it still commandeth perfect obedience for the future. I have nothing to say against this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some will call it <hi>The Law of nature;</hi> against which title nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I any thing to say.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some call it <hi>The Moral Law:</hi> And here Divines speak very variously: many of them call the meer Decalogue, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of the Law of nature, by the name of the Moral Law, without the sanction (either promise, or threatning) others
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118986:82"/> call those precepts, together with the Commination, by the name of the Moral Law: Others call those precepts, with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the promise (supposed to be still in force) even in the same form as it was made to <hi>Adam,</hi> leaving out the positives, by the name of the Moral Law. The first reach not what we now have in question, the last exceed: the second sort I agree with, as to the thing, and mislike not the name.</p>
               <p>4. Others think fitter to call this, <hi>The Law of Christ,</hi> as being part of his Law. This I reject not, it being but matter of words; seeing we are agreed, that now Christ, or God-Redeemer, is Lord of All, and that the Moral Law, or Law of nature, is now his Law: Provided alwayes that we keep a clear distinction between, This Law of nature, (obliging to obedience or punishment) and the special Law of the Redeemer, called, The Law of Grace, or the Promise, which is <hi>Lex Remedians.</hi> But whereas the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether these be now two distinct Laws in force (<hi>quoad speciem</hi>) or only two parts of one Law? I conceive it but meer strife about words, and therefore will not contend in it: We are agreed that both are in force, and that both are now the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Laws; but one <hi>he found</hi> man under, and the other he made <hi>as Redeemer.</hi> We are agreed that they must not be looked on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videdly, but as linkt together; and all are serviceable to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators Government. So that the form of that Law which stood to <hi>Adam,</hi> was this, <hi>Obey me perfectly, and especially in not eating the Fruit of this Tree, and thou shalt live: but if thou sin, thou shalt Dye:</hi> that is, death shall be thy due. This stood thus alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Remedy. The Law that is now in force is this, <hi>Though thou have sinned, and art condemned, yet obey me perfectly for the future, in whatsoever I command thee, and if thou disobey in any thing, for that also death shall be thy due: Yet for the sake of him that Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, if thou wilt believe in him and Repent, thou shalt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and saved; but if thou wilt not, thou shalt be remediless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned.</hi> This is the summe and form of all Gods Law now in force (supposing the particular parts of the matter of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept): And while we confess the thing, the matter is small whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we call this one Law or two, or by what name or titles we call them: though we should keep as neer the Scripture as we can. But they that observe not that it is not the Law made to <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Moses</hi> Law, which <hi>Paul</hi> most frequently mentioneth,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118986:83"/> and calleth the Law of Works, will hardly understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: But what the difference between these two Laws is, as I take it to be a question of so great difficulty, that I never could yet have full satisfaction in any thing that I have seen upon it, so it is not now to be handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 6. They that say, The Law of Works is in force to unbelievers, but abrogated to Believers, or to men as soon as they believe, do speak so gross absurdity or contradiction; that any man man discern it, that knows what the Abrogation of a Law is: The whole Law is repealed and thereby nulled, by Abrogation: And if it were so, it could binde none, much less the same man yesterday, and not to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 7. It is not by any exemption, exception, exposition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or any preventive Dispensation (if such a thing may be) by which Believers are freed from the Laws obligation to punishment: But it is properly, by a pardon, granted Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally before, for the sake of Christs satisfaction; and Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Remitting, and thereby relaxing the Law, or Despensing with it after the guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 8. That this Law containing all the foresaid parts, is yet in force, is at large, and most expresly asserted by the Divines of our late Assembly, whose testimony for number and worth, I have reason to prefer before any single persons. In their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. they say, <hi>God gave to</hi> Adam <hi>a Law, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatned death upon the breach of it; and endued him with power and ability to keep it. This Law after his fall, continued to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of Righteousness, and as such was delivered by God upon Mount</hi> Sinai, &amp;c. Sect. 5. <hi>The moral Law doth for ever binde all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Sect. 6. <hi>Although true Believers are not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, to be thereby justified or condemned, yet it is of great use to them as well as to others, in that as a Rule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is likewise of use to the Regenerate to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin, and the threatnings of it serve to shew, what even their sini deserve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatned in the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the larger Catechism they say, <hi>What is the moral Law?</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:118986:83"/> Answ. <hi>The Moral Law is the Declaration of the Will of God to mankinde, directing and binding every one to personal, perfect, and perpetual conformity and obedience thereunto, in the frame and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the whole man, soul and body, and in performance of all those duties of holyness and righteousness, which he oweth to God and man, promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatning death upon the breach of it.</hi> The uses to all follow.</p>
               <p>Only note what I said before, that the promissory part, I think is now ceased. And therefore I easily confess, that neither the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers nor unbelievers are under the Law as a Covenant of Works, if the word <hi>Covenant</hi> be meant of Gods promise of Life. And as it is a condemning Law, I easily and joyfully acknowledge, that no man is under it as before Christs satisfaction (in moral being) that is, as having no prepared nor offered remedy, but left as the Devils without a Redeemer: And I gladly grant, that it is most proper to say, that no Believer is under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, or under its condemning power: because, 1. All the sins of their life past, are actually remitted. 2. And they are in a sure way for the pardon of future sins, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Seeing as the Moral Law doth bind them to punishment, so the Remedying-Law of Grace dissolveth that obligation, and pardoneth them when they have sinned, they having Faith and Repentance, which is the Condition. Nor doth any new sin destroy their state of Justification, nor make them cease to be Gods recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled children, seeing they are still united to Christ, and have his Spirit, and have Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 9. The Law threateneth or curseth the Elect as well as others, while they are Infidels and unregenerate: For all Christs satisfaction, and Gods Dccree, and the certainty of their future pardon when they believe, and for all God hath foretold that he will call and pardon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 10. God doth execute real punishments on many of the Elect, (yea all) before their conversion: notwithstanding Christ hath satisfied Justice for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 11. No sins of Believers are actually pardoned before they are committed, or in being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 12. Though all true Believers are under Grace, and as to their state and all their former sins, are delivered Actually from the Condemnation, or Obligation of the Law, being truly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118986:84"/> forgiven, and so lyable to none of its threatnings, yet when new sins are by these believers committed, this moral Law is so far in force against them, as to make them guilty of Death, till the Promise come in and remove that guilt by a fresh pardon: It makes death their due, though God by his Gospel do presently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
               <p>I cannot well conceive what should make men accuse me for putting Believers under the curse of the Law, unless it be this Conclusion (and that about punishment, which I shall come to anon). And therefore because it is likely that this is it which Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> is offended at, I shall endeavour to satisfie him, by giving my reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 13. My first is the plain and frequent expressions of Scripture, mentioning both the guilt, punishment and pardon of Believers, which I have sufficiently elsewhere produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 14. My second proof is from the very nature of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise, and the Saints necessity of daily pardon. Where there is no obligation to punishment, there is no pardon: For pardon is but the dissolving of the obligation to punishment, that is, of guilt: no man can possibly be forgiven that is not first guilty of sin to punishment: <hi>Remissio, est Debiti Remissio, &amp; obligationis dissolutio:</hi> It must be therefore <hi>poena debita,</hi> that must be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: As it is evil it is due to the sinner, as it is a means to the end of Government, so the advantage of it is due to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that is, to the Church, and so to God. Now for any man to deny his necessity of pardon, when Christ bids us daily pray, Forgive us our trespasses, and when Scripture so often and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mentioneth our pardon after believing, and directeth to means for that end, (<hi>If you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive, &amp;c.</hi>) is to deny a plain truth, and I doubt, to disclaim a duty which is of necessity to salvation, that is, believing, for pardon, or flying to Christ for pardon by Faith in Prayer and Confession. I conclude therefore that it is of certain truth, that the Law is still in force against Believers, so far as to make them need a pardon from Christ by the Gospel, for every sin they commit: And this is all that ever I asserted, which is by some men accounted such accursed and dangerous Doctrine, against Christ and free-Grace; when I soberly profess to the world, that I would (if the Lord should strengthen me, according to my
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118986:84"/> present purpose) rather suffer death then renounce this Truth, and deny my daily need of pardon by Christ; and I should think to be as good a Martyr (as to my cause) as any that suffered about Transubstantiation, and such like things, from the bloody Papists; whose cause, though clearly good, was yet scarce of such high concernment as this. And I confess, that as wicked and damnable a wretch as Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> makes me, I would not for all the Treasures on earth, be in that mans case at death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who believes that all his sins were so fully pardoned at Christs death, that he hath no need of pardon since, or at least, that all future sins are so pardoned at his first believing, that he hath no need to fly to Christ for daily pardon, nor to pray for it, nor be beholden to God for it, but only for the feeling of it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, supposing that he practically hold this errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 15. My third proof shall be from the necessity of Christs death and satisfaction, for all our sins committed after our believing: Christs satisfaction was by suffering the punishment due to us for our sins, or only instead of it: therefore punishment was considered as such, as would be due to us for them: therefore when we commit them, punishment is due, till God remit it, for the sake of that satisfaction. And if it be due, it must be due by some Law: and it could not be by an abrogated Law, which we were not at all under, and was not in force to us, when we committed them: for <hi>Lex mortua non agit;</hi> no man is made guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a Law which is no Law. Therefore it was by a Law which was in force against us, so far as to make us guilty of damnation, till God forgive us. Call this, the Law of Works, or of nature, or the Moral Law, or what you please; surely such a Law there is, or else Christ could not bear the punishment of any one sin, due to us, except only our sin in <hi>Adam.</hi> I presUme to tender these Reasons of my Dissent, for Mr. <hi>Caryls</hi> satisfaction, if (as its likely) this be the point that offendeth him. And I desire the compassionate Reader to condole the misery of humane frailty, and what a necessity of condemning one another, we seem to be cast upon, through the darkness of our understandings! When I am published a Subverter of Fundamentals (no lower charge) on one side: and when I am constrained my felf to be as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that I should subvert the Foundation it self, if I should think otherwise; and that I must deny that Christ dyed for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118986:85"/> sins of the present world, or ever suffered any punishment that was their due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 16. To these let me add the universal consent of the Church of Christ, till of late; I think I need not tell any man, that ever was conversant in the Fathers in any considerable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, how unanimously they agree in this, without any question made of it, that Believers themselves fall under guilt upon renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sins, and have need of fresh pardon; yea they thought that many actions must be performed which were <hi>sine quibus non,</hi> to actual pardon: Were it not past all doubt, I could and would quickly give you testimony enough of this: that decantate speech of <hi>Austins</hi> may suffice for all, so commonly approved by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines, <hi>Non Remittitur peccatum, nisi Restituatur ablatum,</hi> without Restitution, there is no Remission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 17. Nor have the Reformed Churches forsaken the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Churches of Christ in this Doctrine, as is evident in all their Confessions past doubt. I will cite the words of that most learned and famous Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> consisting of the Delegates of so many Churches, <hi>Artic. 5. §. 5. Talibus autem enormibus pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis Deum valde offendunt, Reatum mortis incurrunt, Spiritum S. contristant, fidei exercitium interrumpunt, conscientiam gravissimè, vulnerant, sensum gratiae ad tempus nonnunquam amittunt: donec per seram Resipiscentiam in viam revertentibus paternus Dei vultus rursum affulgeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 18. The Reverend Divines of this Nation, have gone commonly the same way, as is undeniably evident in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Tractates. Instead of troubling you with many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I will give you many in one, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Confession and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism of our late Reverend Assembly: <hi>Confes.</hi> Ch. 6. §. 6. <hi>Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression of the righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and Curse of the Law, and so made subject to death, with all miseries spiritual, temporal, and eternal.</hi> Here is as much, if not more, then ever I said: If any object, that they only say, It is the nature of sin to do thus, if Christ did prevent it? I answer, No such matter: They say not, <hi>It would do thus,</hi> but <hi>It doth thus;</hi> and that Christ came only to prevent our guilt and obligation to punishment, and consequently to prevent our need of pardon for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118986:85"/> any sin after Regeneration, and not to give us pardon when we need it, is, as I have shewed, a Doctrine unfit for Christian tongues or ears; <hi>Sin doth</hi> (first) <hi>in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curse of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. say the Assembly; and then, in order of nature, after (whatever it be in time) the Promise in the blood of Christ, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth this Obligation, and Remitteth this guilt and curse.</p>
               <p>So in the larger Catechism, <hi>Every sin, even the least, being against the Soveraignty, Goodness, and Holyness of God, and against his righteous Law, deserveth his wrath and curse, both in this life, and that which is to come, and cannot be expiated but by the blood of Christ.</hi> And <hi>that we may escape the wrath and curse of God, due to us f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r sin, he requireth of us Repentance, &amp;c.</hi> There must be then a guilt or obligation by or to the curse, for every sin in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before it is remitted, by the Application of Christs blood. This is as much as ever I said, this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 19. I am very confident that the very new nature of a Regenerate man, as consisting in his humility, self-denyal, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Hatred of sin, and sense of the need of Christ, and the Grace of God in pardoning, doth contain in it somewhat that is really opposite to the contrary opinion, and that if a true Christian should say, <hi>I am not guilty: or I deserve not the wrath and curse of God for my sin: or no punishment is due to me:</hi> there is something within him that would rise against him, and draw back with abhorrence from consenting hereto. And if he should be drawn by seduction and faction, to hold such opinions specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, yet true Grace will not suffer him to hold them practically and prevalently: For so to hold them, I think, is inconsistent with true Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 20. I do not know that ever I heard any that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Orthodox, pray to God and confess their sins, but they would confess that they deserved the wrath and curse of God: And he that will deny this, shall never be my mouth to God in prayer, if I can help it. As nature teacheth the poor Infant to cry in the feeling of its hurts or hunger: So truly doth the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach every Christian to cry to God for pardon, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that it deserveth his wrath and curse for sin. If the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians say, that hereby I censure them as Grace-less, and in a damnable state; I <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let them see to it, that it be not so.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118986:86"/> 2. I hope many of them hold not those errors practically and predominantly, but speculatively, which the contrary opinion lyes, though clouded and unobserved, yet most practical in their secret minds. Were it not for this hope, I confess, I would shake off all communion with this sort of men, and look on their case as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorate. Yet they would make great out-cryes against me, if I should allow a Papist or Socinian so charitable thoughts, as if it were possible for them to hold their more desperate errors but speculatively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 21. They that deny that every sin of the Regenerate deserveth Gods wrath and curse, must affirm that Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the very Law of nature. And they that hold that the Law of nature is not destroyed, must needs hold that we deserve Gods wrath and curse for sin. For this is most legibly written in that Law. If any say, We do deserve it, but yet we are not guilty, or obliged to punishment, I <hi>Answ.</hi> That is a contradiction, if by guilt and obligation, you mean, the first dueness of the punishment, before Remission come in and destroy the guilt. For the <hi>Desert</hi> of punishment, is but <hi>what is due by the Law of nature.</hi> If they say, we only deserve what Christ hath suffered, and not that we should suffer our selves. Now he hath already suffered: I <hi>Answ.</hi> The misunderstanding of the nature of Christs satisfaction is the Root of all these mischievous errors. We first deserve it to our selves, before it can be considered as due to Christ, because due to us: and Christ suffered what would be due to us, upon foresight that it would be due to us: and therefore he did not die to prevent that due, but to remove it. Nor did he take us from under Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by his death: and therefore we are Subjects, and under the Moral Law, which doth still bind us to obey or suffer, till Christ pardon. Remission is not the immediate effect of Christs death, nor comes from his blood as <hi>shed</hi> only: but as <hi>Applied</hi> after it is considered <hi>as shed.</hi> I do not use to find Practical Divines in their Writings or Sermons, perswade Christians only that they deserved that Christ should suffer, or teach only such Confessions to God; But also that themselves have deserved to themselves the Wrath of God, and Curse of his Law: And I do not use to hear Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Christians in their prayers, only confessing, <hi>Lord, we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the sufferings of Christ;</hi> but also, <hi>Lord, we deserve thy wrath and curse for our sins, our daily sins.</hi> Such observations make
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118986:86"/> me desirous, to leave it even in Capital letters to posterity, that PRACTICE IS THE EXCELLENT HELP TO BE TRULY ORTHODOX: THE PRACTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL EXPERIMENTAL PREACHERS AND PEOPLE, DO HOLD FAST THOSE TRUTHS TO SALVATION WHICH OPINIONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISTS AND MEER DISPUTERS ARE EI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER EASILY DRAWN FROM, OR HOLD BUT SPECULATIVELY AND DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN IN UNRIGHTEOUSNESS TO THEIR OWN PERDITION. Which makes me perswade young Students still (though I now apprehend it more sensibly then ever) that it is not a loss of time, as some would perswade them, to read much our Practical Divines, but that in such they shall find the truth more soundly, and soberly delivered, then in most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputers that pretend to be more exact. And especially in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian points and all others that are against Christian experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Hooker, Bolton, Rogers, Hildersham, Fenner,</hi> and such like, are the best Confuters of them, that seem not directly to meddle with the men.</p>
               <p>A Practical experienced Defender of the Truth, is highly to be valued and honored by the Church: An unsanctified man, that is Orthodox and of able parts, may be useful to the Church: But if such be possessed with a zeal for their opinions, which they call the Orthodox Doctrine, they usually prove the most unhappy misleaders, especially if it be about those Truths that experience must do much in discovering. And the Godly and learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves DO LOSE THAT TRUTH TOO OFTEN IN DISPUTATIONS, WHICH BEFORE THEY HELD IN SOBER PRACTICE. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next to impossibility for men that are not of extraordinary so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, to forbear running into extreams in the heat of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I speak not this to disswade men from studying to know the truth, or from defending it: But Controversie is not alway the best Teacher of it. And to manage Controversie, it is but here and there a quick-sighted man that is fit for it: (O how rare are they!) Nor must they meddle with it but upon urgent Cause. I speak this in the consciousness of my own unfitness, however I am drawn to it by others. But I digress.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:118986:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 22. I do believe that Jesus Christ hath a special Law of Grace, which though it have the promise of life for its most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part, yet also containeth a peremptory threatning of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless destruction to men, if they will not Repent and Believe: And though I know that no Believer is so under this Threatning, as to be guilty by it, and obliged to damnation, yet is he so under it, as every subject is under the Penal Laws, who do not incurre the penalty. The threatning of this Law, speaks to Believers as well as to others. God doth not only say to Infidels, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not you shall perish; but also to Believers, If any man shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. And if ye forsake him, he also will forsake you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nclu.</hi> 23. I do fully believe, that when a true Believer is actually Justified, from all his sins past, yet that all the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or non-amission of that Justified state, and also the pardon of all following sins and also his final Absolution in Judgement, are all still Conditional▪ Though I believe that they are certainly and infallibly future, and the event foretold in Scripture, and God, as it were, engaged to accomplish it, and that God hath actually and absolutely Decreed it, (I mean, there is no Condition of the act of his Decree, and also that he hath Decreed immutably the infallible futurition of the event): and a sober man would think that this were enough to free me, from their charge of Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism: Yet still I am certain, the Promise doth give us personally our Right to these benefits on condition. The same God that saw it meet to Decree the event absolutely, did also see it meet to accomplish that Decree, by making a conditional Grant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the blessing, and to enable his elect to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that so he might lead men to heaven under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Law, and the force of its motives, and not as bruits, nor as masterless, and Lawless. And they that deny this, shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too bruitish or lawless to be Divines; and know not what the Law of the King of Saints is, and therefore are unfit to preach and expound it.</p>
               <p>Yea, though a Believer attain to never so great certainty that he shall eventually persevere and be saved, and absolved at last, yet is it nevertheless conditionally given in the Promise; and his assurance is not because there is no Condition, but because he is assured he shall perform the Condition; (which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118986:87"/> he hath from another Promise, and not from this.)</p>
               <p>The text before mentioned proveth this, <hi>Heb. 10. 38. If any man draw back,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col. 1. 21, 22, 23. And you that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable, and unreprovable in his sight. If ye continue in the Faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12. <hi>If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him; If we deny him, he also will deny us;</hi> Rev. 2. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c. vers. 11. 17. 26. and 3. 5. 12. 21. Joh. 15. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Now yee are clean through the Word that I have spoken unto you▪ Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me, &amp;c. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my Disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ye in my love. If ye keep my Commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Commandments and abide in his love.</hi> Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end. 14. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our Confidence sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast unto the end.</hi> Heb. 10. 23, 26, 30, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Let us hold fast the profession of our Faith without wavering▪ for he is faithful that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.

This the Apostle speaks to them that <hi>took joyfully the spoyling of their goods▪ knowing in themselves that they had in heaven a better and more enduring substance;</hi> and that had received confidence, and of whom he expresseth his own confidence of them. Yet he saith further, <hi>We know him that hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cast not away therefore your Confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118986:88"/> the Promise.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. <hi>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.</hi> Mark. <hi>And when ye stand praying, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, if ye have ought against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</hi> Mat. 6. 12, 14 and 18. 35. <hi>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</hi> Rom 8. 13. <hi>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the body, ye shall live.</hi> A multitude of such texts might quickly be produced: But the general tenor of the Promise puts all out of doubt, seeing it is made but to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Penitent ones, or to men if they will believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; therefore should they cease to believe and repent, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise would cease to justifie them, and give them right to Christ and Life. And to put such a supposition by way of dispute is far from being so absurd as Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> makes it, when God himself doth put it so oft in his Word, and a Christian must put it to his own heart, to prevent his Apostacy, <hi>What a hainous sin were it! and what a fearful case were I in, if I should Apostatize!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I do not leave a Christian unjustified (for all this) till death, as Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> frequently chargeth me to do, I have shewed before, and may do further anon. We are not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, but Actually Justified when we believe: But it follows not that we are jufiified from all the sin that is yet uncommitted, any otherwise then Conditionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 24. I do believe that God Judged <hi>Adam,</hi> and mankind in him, for the first sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. for all the promise of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and that he Executed, at least, part of the sentence there passed (or rather All, that All being but part of what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.) And it is my opinion that the evils there mentioned, which still lie on Believers, are fruits of that first sin, and of the threatning (or Curse, if you will so call that small part of the Threat) of that Law, which Jesus Christ hath undertaken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, but not at once, but by degrees, so that the last shall not be removed till the Resurrection, this Life being the time which Christ as Physician hath taken for the performing of the Cure, that he may then present us spotless and perfectly sound to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that he did not all this cure on the cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 25. Certain I am that the sanctified themelves are under Punishment, and that Punishment is the effect of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118986:88"/> of some Law, whichsoever it be, or whatever you will call it, and that threat is it in one sense, and the execution in another, that is commonly called the Curse of that Law. But if any will make it a contest, whether it be the Law of works, or of Nature, or the moral Law (which are all one to me) or the Law of Grace, whose Threatning it is that is executed on Believers, I will not contend with him, it being but about notions and words. But I choose to say, that it is partly and originally from the Law of works made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the sentence following the breach: partly also from the Threat of the Moral or Natural Law, as it is now in the hands of Christ, and partly also by Consequence (though not as to the inflicting, yet as the very non-liberation in such a degree and season, is a punishment) it may be said to be from the Commination of the Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 26.

               <p>I have been so long on this Testimony of <hi>Paraeus</hi> that I must omit the rest, whereof I shall soon produce an hundred, if I do but understand that it will be worth the labour. Here I recur to my former observation, How the fury of contentious Disputation would rob men of that, which both Grace and Nature evidently teach. And I shall but desire the Reader that wants humane Testimony, 1. To read over our English Sermons that have been preached in any times of Plague or other Calamity, or on daies of humiliation, whereof of late years we have had great store, and tell me whether they deny Gods anger, and displeasure, his threatning and our sin, to be causes of our sufferings? 2. To hearken to the Confessions of the Godly in their sufferings, yea of the opposers of this truth, when they come to lye under any long or heavy suffering, and approach their death, and hear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will say, that none of this is a punishment for sin, nor from Gods wrath▪ or threatning, and whether they never pray God to turn from his wrath and displeasure against them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 27. Punishment is the <hi>Genus:</hi> and it is, A Natural Evil inflicted for a Moral Evil: or <hi>malum passionis propter malum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi> as some define it, Punishment is either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, which we call ordinarily chastilement, which is for the amendment of the sufferer, so that chastisement is a <hi>species</hi> of punishment. If any doubt of this, I will give him a catalogue long enough of Schoolmen, Lawyers, Philosophers and Reformed Divines to prove it, as soon as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 28. Gods sanctifying the sufferings of the Saints, and working out of them a greater good, doth not make them cease to be Evils in their own nature, nor to be so far as evil, punishments for our sins▪ The good is but by accident, Poison is poison still, though the Physitian can make a medicine of it: yea in the use it is still poenal, as being a natural evil inflicted for a moral evil, that is, for sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 2. God threatneth these things to his own people if they sin. The matter of all threatnings is evil of Punishment: therefore these chastisements are Evils of punishment. It is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118986:90"/> Benefit of the suffering, and not the suffering it self that God promiseth. God doth not threaten to do men Good, nor promise them punishment, as punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 30. Let the Holy Scripture be judge whether they are Punishments or not, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Wherefore doth a living man complain? A man for the Punishment of his sins? 4. 6. For the Punishment of the Iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater then,</hi> &amp;c. 22. <hi>The Punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hos. 12. 2. <hi>The Lord also hath a Controversie with</hi> Judah <hi>and will punish</hi> Jacob <hi>according to his ways, according to his doings will he recomperse him.</hi> Amos 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities,</hi> Ezra 9. <hi>Thou our God hast punished us less then our iniquities.</hi> Jer. 9. 25. <hi>I will punish all you that are Circumcised with the uncircumcised.</hi> Lev. 26. 18, 24. <hi>I will punish you seven times more,</hi> &amp;c. Lev. 26. 24, 41, 43. <hi>If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they accept of the Punishment of their Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. (Its certain some among the Jews were sincere.) Psal. 73. 5. <hi>Its said of the wicked that they are not plagued like other men.</hi> And verse 14. David <hi>saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, All the day long have I been Plagued, and chastened every morning.</hi> Psal. 36. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure: For thine Arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore: There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger, neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</hi> So Psal. 6. 1. 1 Cor. 11. 30. <hi>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep: For if we would Judge our selves we should not be judged. But when we are Judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world.</hi> And the word <hi>chastisement</hi> is put frequently in Scripture, (not only for the Paternal Punishing of Children with intents of special good to them thereby, but also) for the Punishment even of enemies: or for any punishment in general. Psal. 94. 10. <hi>He that chastiseth the Heathen, shall not he correct?</hi> Isa. 53. 5. <hi>The chastisement of our Peace was upon him, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 30. 14, 15. And that all our chastisements are Punishments, the definition given them frequently in scripture telleth us. For it ever ascribeth them to mans sin, as the provoking meritorious Cause: and to Gods anger, as the efficient cause; and speaketh of them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118986:90"/> as hurtful in themselves. And <hi>evil of suffering, inflicted for sin,</hi> is Punishment. Nay that Mr. <hi>Cradon</hi> may see that I have spoken no higher then Scripture, see divers places where imperfect par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is mentioned, or where some sins of the Regenerate are said to be in some respect unpardoned. Lam. 3. 42. <hi>We have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed and have Rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.</hi> Num. 14. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 29, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of this people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word: But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the Glory of the Lord: Because all those men which have seen my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkned to my voice, surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it. 29. Your Carkasses shall fall in this wilderness, &amp;c. 33, 34. And your children shall wander in the wilderness fourty years, and bear your whoredoms until your Carcasses be wasted in the wilderness. After the number of the days,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall ye bear your iniquities, even four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</hi> Nay if I had said that a mans sins may be partly unpardoned, when his soul is in Heaven, what a peal would Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> have rung me? yet as to Executive pardon, which is not punishing, consider whether the Bodies lying in the grave to the Resurrection be no punishment? which is unremitted as to the execution, though it be remitted perfectly as to the Right of a Resurrection at that time. And see an Example of a mans sins punished on his Posterity, when his soul was at rest, and God would not pardon them: 2 Kings 24. 4. <hi>Surely at the Commandment of the Lord came this upon</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of</hi> Manasseh <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he did: and also for the innocent blood that he shed, (for he filled</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with innocent blood) which the Lord would not pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 31. I think those that are against me in this confess, that the Regenerate are under a threatning, and are punished with temporal punishments, and consequently that Punishments they are: so the Marrow of Modern Divinity, where it earnestly pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Believers not to look at their sins <hi>as making them lyable to Gods everlasting wrath and Hell-sire, nor to crave pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness for them that thereupon they may escape that penalty;</hi> yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118986:91"/> saith that the Law of Christ threatneth a penalty which we must fear and pray to have our sins pardoned as to that penalty: which is <hi>the want of neer and sweet Communion with God in Christ, even in the time of this life, and a lyableness to all temporal afflictions, as fruits and effects of the transgressions of that Law; and therefore when ever we feel the Lords chastening hands on us, he would have us ask forgiveness of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as we are taught in the Lords prayer;</hi> page 206. 208. 210. Now I would know how this standeth with perfect pardon: and how it comes to pass that man must bear any punishment himself, when Christ hath made a perfect satisfaction? when they have answered themselves, they will perhaps see what others may answer. But I should have thought that this doctrine here delivered, against praying for pardon, as to the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, should have made a Christians ears to tingle, and he should have felt by experience the Spirit of Christ within him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting it. I Confess these and many other such passages which I then mention'd (&amp; Mr <hi>Cr.</hi> hath like himself attempted to palliate) did urge me in the <hi>Append.</hi> of my <hi>Aphor.</hi> to say somewhat against it, <hi>p.</hi> 99. and in the <hi>Aphor. p.</hi> 330▪ to marvail <hi>that such a Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k should have so many applauding Epistles of such Divines.</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> takes not these words ill, because there are two Epistles of his: For as I unfeignedly reverenced him, and some others whose Epistles I there found, so I neither named him, nor intended his dishonor: though I cannot deny but that I am sorry to see his name both there, and here (in Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 32. Nay the punishment which remaineth unremoved, (and so far unpardoned) to the Saints in this life, is not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, or small, as to occasion men to deny it to be evil, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. For 1. The earth and other creatures retain still that Curse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. which was passed on it for our sakes, and so was our punishment. 2. Man undergoeth that life of labor &amp; sweat there threatned. 3. The seed of the Serpent bruiseth our heel, as was sentenced. Satan hath power to tempt us to sin, frequently and violently, and that to haynous sins; which is a sore punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it self to the Godly: Though I say not that all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is penal, for <hi>Adam</hi> had some in innocency: Yet to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to frequent sin, foul temptations, is: and to have the Messenger of Satan to buffet us. 4. Wicked men are left, as thorns in our sides, not only to vex us, but to provoke us to evil,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118986:91"/> and to entice us with them to sin, which we are too prone too of our selves. 5. The Godly are oft punished justly by men for their miscarriages; and perhaps with death it self. 6. But the sorest punishment is sin it self, which as it is permitted and left unhealed, is a punishment of former sin. I think those that are most offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, will yield to this, and like well of Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> copious endeavours to prove that God punisheth sin with sin, in his elaborate audacious Disputations <hi>de Provident à Paul</hi> groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this penalty, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. The estrangedness from God, loss of communion with him, sense of his displeasure, wants of Grace and comfort, are no small punishments. 8. So is death and the bodyes lying in the earth till the Resurrection without life or fruition of God. If it be said that these do work for our greater good. I <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is certain our sufferings for Christ do. 2. Castigatory afflictions are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our good, but that is by accident that they accomplish it, and are nevertheless punishments themselves. 3. God would give us the good, without the evil of punishment, if we did not sin. 4. It is contrary to the judgement of many of the best Expositors, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. doth speak of sin; And it is hard to shew how all sin worketh for our good. It is possible a Godly man may lose his first Love in a great measure, and decline to a very low degree of Grace, and a scandalous life, and a terrified conscience, and so die; And how it should do him good to Love God▪ less then he did, to have less faith, less humility, &amp;c. I know not, when the good of Affliction is to encrease these Graces. Besides every man dyeth in some degree of sin habitual▪ and actual, which is not cured till he leave the flesh: and what good that last sin doth him, I know not. Nor do I remember any Promise that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies lying in the Grave till the Resurrection, shall be better then if he had ascended with <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> though Christ love and regard that very dust, and will give it at last a greater happiness then we lost. All this punishment▪ therefore I suppose is yet left unremoved, and if you will call this the curse or part of the curse, it must be said that part of the curse is not actually removed. Yet I conceive it fittest to say that believers are freed from the curse, and are not under it. 1. Because the word <hi>Curse,</hi> usually signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great destroying penalty, inconsistent with Gods special Love, and making the sinner accursed, that is, miserable: and so
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118986:92"/> we are freed from it, for every Believer is freed and justified, from any charge that can be brought against him as to damnation, or destructive-punishment. 2. And their right to a future delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is more full then the actual deliverance yet is. 3. It is our own sin that hath made sufferings necessary to our good. 4. As long as Christ hath made sure for us in heaven a far greater glory then we lost, and which will make all these sufferings to be none, we may well say, that he hath done the office of a Saviour perfectly, though the time be not yet come for our full deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 33. Though in our first Justification and pardon, we are acquit from all sin past, and nothing lyeth against us, and so that Justification may be said to be perfect and have no degrees, yet I conceive that our pardon is not absolutely perfect as it shall be at the last. My reasons are 1. As to the continuance of it, it is yet but conditional (how certain soever): and that is not so perfect, as it will be when the Condition is performed: even our perseverance, which is the Condition of persevering Justification. 2. We have many a thousand sins yet to be pardoned, that were not pardoned at first, as not then existing. 3. And all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said penalties to be remitted actually, by the removal of them. 4. And the great absolution at judgement is behinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 34. It is not only affliction as such, but punishment as punishment, that is necessary both to Gods great ends in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, and also in particular, to the best Saint on earth, for the right ordering of his life. Meer affliction is no act of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as such, but punishment is. And if men suffer never so much, and know not that it is for sin, and from Gods displeasure, and to scourge them to obedience, it will not do them that good that it is sent for, and must be done. If Christ had delivered Believers from being under any threat, or lyable to any execution of a threatning for sin, then he had brought them to be from under Law, and then he had set them from under Government, and then he had set them from under God, and then he had either made them Gods, or else bruits uncapable of Government. Whiles Saints are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and while they are under Government, God will govern them by the due means and instruments of Government, Laws ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Rewards and Punishments annext.</p>
               <p>How and by what Laws he Governeth the Glorified, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical nature, I pretend not to know, (further then that the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118986:92"/> knowledge of God himself, and so of his holy Nature and Will, is their Law, which conjoyned with perfect Love and holyness, will procure perfect obedience and blessedness) But sure I am that as the Angels themselves, when they (some of them) fell, were subjected to penalty, and so its like did before live under a kinde of penal Law, that is, knew that if they sinned they should suffer, so much more clear is it to us, that man while he is in flesh, is not otherwise to be governed agreeably to his nature. And Grace it self is not given him to be instead of this Law, and so to make it void, but to conform him to it in mind and life. And as threatnings are of necessity for the Government of the Saints themselves, so are some degree of execution. For a threatning which we know shall never be executed, though we offend, is no threatning: and is as dishonourable to the Lawgiver, as useless to the subject; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where the same Lawgiver prescribeth certain terms and means for remedy, and so the case is divolved thither. Nor did God see it consistent with our present safety here, to remedy the whole by a perfect Impunity. Man hath flesh and sense, as well as Reason, and hath need of some Execution as well as of the threatning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 35. None of a Believers Castigatory punishments, do in the least measure satisfie Gods Justice: Yet is there some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of Justice in and by them so far as they are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; though there may be a far greater Demonstration of Love, in and by them, in regard of the good to which they are intended.</p>

                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 36. It is not the least dishonor to Christs satisfaction, or derogation from its sufficiency and perfection, to say that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers bear some penalty themselves. Because Christs satisfaction is to be denominated sufficient and perfect▪ in reference to its ends, and intended effects: And it was never his end in satisfying, to take his people from under a penal Law in this life, nor to cure the wound which the first sin made, perfectly, till the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to free men from all sin, or all sufferings of Castigatory punishments in this life. See <hi>Paraeus</hi> words before cited, to this effect: And the Confession of the <hi>Marrow of Modern Divines,</hi> about temporal penalties. (The same reason clearly proveth that it is no derogation from Christs satisfaction or merits, that we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118986:93"/> a necessity of Obedience, and performance of Conditions▪ for obtaining of some of the fruits of his satisfaction)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 37. How far a true Believer may lie under terrors and wounds of conscience, and how long and how commonly they may doubt of salvation (by <hi>may,</hi> I mean not lawfully, but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, not <hi>Debet</hi> but <hi>Potest</hi>) I have shewed my thoughts in my Method for Peace of conscience. And sad experience speaks it too loud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 38. How far also it may accidentally be a duty for a Believer in some sad Cases to question his Justification or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and so to search after it, (though it be his great sin that he is in that uncertainty, and his greater sin that caused it) I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my thoughts in the same book</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 30. How far a Believer may fear hell, and labour to escape it, I have shewed my thoughts in the same book, and the <hi>Append.</hi> of my <hi>Aphor.</hi> and somewhat before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 40. By all that hath been said on the Negative and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative concerning the Laws obliging Believers to punishment, for every sin till Remission do dissolve the Obligation, It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Obligation of the Law to Believers, is exceedingly different from the Obligation to <hi>Adam</hi> before the Promise, or the Obligation on unbelievers, or the Obligation of the Law of Grace, on the finally impenitent and unbelievers. The Law obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Adam</hi> before the Promise, without any Remedy, existent, or revealed: And therefore if he had then been Judged, before the Interposition of a Saviour, he must have been condemned and executed. The Law obligeth unbelievers to eternal punishment, by an actual obligation, remaining in full force upon them, and as truly unremedied and not dissolved as if there had been no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy provided, (till they believe) but yet a Remedy sufficient is offered if they will accept it; and the Moral Law alone, is not the Rule of their judgement to Condemnation: but before the sentence pass, it will be enquired whether or no they accepted and used the Remedy. The Law of the Redeemer, or of Grace doth pass a Peremptory, Irreversible, Remediless sentence (vertually) on all that die unbelievers and impenitent: But the Obligation of the Moral Law on the Believer for every new sin, is such as hath a perfect Remedy at hand, even Christ and the Promise, and he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118986:93"/> hath a certain present interest in that Christ and Promise, and hath the Spirit within him to cause a renewed application, and (at least for ordinary sins of infirmity) it seems that the Habit of Faith and Repentance which is ever in him, is a Condition which qualifieth him for present Remission; and so the guilt is but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient, and the justisted state is permanent, nor is it such a guilt as makes an intercession in our Adoption or Union with Christ, or casteth us out of Gods favour: but only maketh Remission ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: And most properly we must say, that the Law conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we <hi>deserve</hi> punishment, and speaketh meerly <hi>de Debitô,</hi> but nothing <hi>de Eventu,</hi> against a Believer, Observe this: A Law as a Law, doth directly constitute Dueness, and so the Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes the Penalty <hi>due</hi> to the Delinquent. One use of the Law is to be <hi>Norma Judicii;</hi> and God is Just, and therefore though the Law as a Law simply bind not him to execute it, nor deprive him of a power to Relax it and Dispense with it; yet the perfect wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Justice of the Law-giver, and the ends of Government, forbid the doing of this▪ but upon a valuable consideration, which may equally attain those ends: So that Implyedly, Indirectly, by Accident, the Law most commonly speaks <hi>de Eventu,</hi> as it doth directly, and <hi>per se de Debito:</hi> So that the subject must expect the Execution. This being premised, I apply it to our Case. The Law so condemned <hi>Adam,</hi> that it gave him cause to expect the execution eventually (till the remedy was revealed) as well as to conclude it his Due. The Law so condemneth unbelievers, (though Elect) that it gives them cause to expect the Execution eventually, unless they will believe; and therefore to expect it while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unbelievers. The Law of Nature and Grace so condemn all final unbelievers, as that they are left without hope, its sentence being Peremptory and Irreversible, not only <hi>de Jure,</hi> but also <hi>de Eventu,</hi> foretelling that there shall never be a Remedy. And this is Accidental, or added to it, as it is a Law: and in this it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in tenor the very Law of Works in its utmost rigour to <hi>Adam:</hi> for though that contained no Remedy, yet it excluded it not for the future, as this doth. But now the Moral Law, doth so threaten punishment to a true Believer for his daily frailties, as that it only as a Law doth constitute the <hi>Debitum poenae;</hi> it speaks <hi>de Jure,</hi> what we deserve; but <hi>de Eventu,</hi> that we shall actually suffer hell fire, it hath not a word to say; because the Promise stops its
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118986:94"/> mouth: So that it gives not the Believer any just cause to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the eventual Execution of it, but only to bewail his sin, and flie to Christ, and beg and receive pardon from him by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. In a word. The Law bound <hi>Adam</hi> to a punishment Irremis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as to any remedy then revealed, but not so absolutely. The Law bindeth unbelievers to a punishment remissible (in Law), but uncertain whether it shall be remitted. It bindeth Believers to a punishment presently to be remitted. It bindeth final unbelievers and impenitent Rebels against the Lord that bought them, to a Punishment, Absolutely as to the Event, Remediless and Irremissible.</p>
               <p>But I will add this true Confession of my Heart, how ever it be taken: Though I have truly spoke my opinion concerning the speed and facility of the pardon of Believers sins; yet I am not able to practice according to this opinion. I find something within me, that will not suffer me so easily or quickly to conclude that I am pardoned: Nay that forceth me to beg pardon daily for all the past sins of my life, and especially the more observable; and that as earnestly, as if they were newly committed: yea and forceth me to conceive, that I do well in so doing: and indeed so carrieth me to it, that I dare not forbear it, nor repent it: but indeed have much to say to Justifie it.</p>
               <p>And thus Reader, I have given thee my Confession, how far I think Believers are yet under the Law and its threatning, or the effects thereof. And for all these two last Chapters, thou maiest thank Mr. <hi>Caryls</hi> Epistle to Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> Book: For I was passing on further, when that came to my hands; and judged it necessary to make this Addition for the satisfying of so Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend a man as Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> perceiving him so deeply offended, as to suppose that Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> vindicateth, and consequently that I oppose the very fundamentals of a Christians Comforts, about his deliverance from the Curse of the Law, and his Justification by Works, and Faith as a Work. The Lord of Mercy grant that my soul miss not of any part of the deliverance which I have here professed to acknowledge, and then I doubt not but I shall be everlastingly happy, notwithstanding all my omissions, or mistakes, or the censures of my Brethren.</p>
               <p>But I must entreat the Reader to expect but little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Method in these Propositions, for indeed I do but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118986:94"/> hastily write them down as they come into my memory.</p>
               <p>But yet I remember one thing more I have undertaken to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for Mr. <hi>Caryl;</hi> of which next.</p>
               <p>Reader, <hi>In this place I added my Reply to Mr.</hi> Crandon, <hi>which upon consideration of its unfitness for this place, I have since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the end of my Apology.</hi>

                  </gap>ists ascribe no more meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to Works then I do, no not any of them: Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> saith of my Doctrine of <hi>Merit</hi> thus, pag. 192. par. 1. <hi>In general I affirm, there is not to be found any of the most Trentified and deepest branded Papists, that hath in this point spoken more derogatorily of the Grace of God, and more superlatively to the exalting of mans menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Righteousness; but contrariwise divers, especially of the more ancient Schoolmen that have spoken more modestly and moderately of both then Mr.</hi> Br.</p>
               <p>And pag. 190. <hi>Can he name any one of the worst Papists or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites that doth attribute merit to mans Works in a higher degree then? or doth not when he hath extolled mans merits salve the Grace of God as finely as himself? Are not his words and theirs about Gods
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118986:95"/> Grace and mans Merits the same? Doth he add any thing here of his own that he hath not learned of them? Do not</hi> Bellarmine <hi>and his Brethren speak altogether so fully and more fully, seemingly to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>I promised on this occasion to shew you how ill these men deal with the Ninth Commandment, by producing sufficient evidence of the falshood of their speeches: Though I need not do it for any man of reading; yet for the sake of younger scholars I will briefly do somewhat.</p>
               <p>What my own Judgement is concerning Merit, I have fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: I disclaim the very name, as unfit for our use in this case: Yet I say, Improperly and unfitly and largely, our works may be called Meritorious; not that they <hi>may fitly</hi> or <hi>lawfully</hi> be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but that the thing is true which is so spoken, though the terms be unfit: and thus all our Divines against the Papists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Fathers: and this is all that ever I held or wrote.</p>
               <p>Now that the Papists do ascribe more to, or say more of the merit of works, then I do, I shall leave past question, when I have shewed you, 1. What our writers charge them with, 2. What they say themselves, so that if you will believe either Protestants, or Papists themselves, the case shall be clear.</p>
               <p>But before I come to it, I have these two things to premise. 1. I do here confess that Satan took occasion from the false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the men before named, and the unconscionable spleenish Jealousies and Censures of many others, to assault me with a Temptation to a very grievous sin; that is, to have stretcht and rackt the words of the Papists to the utmost that I could, thereby to make them seem more distant from the Protestants then indeed they are, that I might thereby appear to be as distant from them. He thus set upon me to move me to this sin. <hi>Thou seest what furious spirits are in many men, and how violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable they are against dissenters, and how little Conscience they make of the vilest slanders; and what firebrands they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the poor divided Church. If thou dost not manifest yet a greater distance from Papists, they will brand thee every where as a Papist or as Erroneous and too near them: and though thou little regard this as to thy own name, yet oughtest thou to regard it for the benefit of the Church: For if thy name by these men be blasted, and a Jealousie and</hi> Odium <hi>raised on thy doctrine, thy Labours will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118986:95"/> unprofitable; and the common people will be deterred from the reading of thy writings, or read them with prejudice; yea and the world will be prejudiced against the truths which thou delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, as supposing them to be Poperie, and will neither receive them now from thee, nor hereafter from any other. There is no way therefore to be taken but by making the worst of their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to make the world believe that the Papists are more erroneous and further from us in the doctrine of Merit and Justification then indeed they are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Premises were too true, that is, the Antecedent; but the consequence so bad, and the Conclusion so evidently contrary to Gods word, that quickly shewed me that it was from the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>2. I do therefore now profess, that if Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyr's</hi> words were true, that the Papists give no more to works, nor make them any otherwise Meritorious then I do; I am heartily glad of it, and shall hope that they are so much nearer the Truth and the Reformed Churches then they have been taken to be.</p>
               <p>And I do profess that if I knew that the Papists hold every point that I hold, I would not therefore forsake one of them, no more then I will deny God, because the Papists do confess him: but I would be glad that we were unanimous: nor shall the name of Popery, by the grace of God deter me from owning any truth that I know, or from Receiving any that I do not know.</p>
               <p>I do also profess, upon a survey of their writings, that many hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd incendiaries on both sides do perswade the world that our distance is greater in the doctrine of Justification and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, then indeed it is: And I do believe that it would be a very useful work of any that write against the Papists on these points, to gather the nominal controversies by themselves, and then let us see all the Real doctrinal differences by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when the verbal differences are laid by, that we may know how far we differ indeed, in the matter, and how far in meer words. To which Purpose Mr. <hi>Wo oton d Reconcil.</hi> hath said somewhat. For example, seeing they use and obstinately will use, the word <hi>Justification</hi> for Sanctification, or as including it, which we do not; and seeing we confess that Justification and Remission of sin are either all one, or differing but notionally, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118986:96"/> very little, or that Remission and Acceptance is our Justification; and seeing that we are better agreed with the Papists about the meaning of the word <hi>remission of sin</hi> then about the word <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> were it not worth the while to enquire diligently how far we agree and diasgree, about Remission of sin, and that while lay by the notion of Justification?</p>
               <p>I do also believe that it is a hainous sin in any man to study to widen the difference, and make it seem greater, then indeed it is: when firebrands have consumed themselves in making havock of Christs Church, it is Healing and Closing in peaceable Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and humble conjunction in enquiring after truth, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the tollerable failings of each other, that must Recover the Church if ever it be Recovered, and must find that Truth, that is now lost by contention, and covered in the Ashes and the Ruines which faction and passion have turned some into. Restauration and Healing lies more in uniting and closing, then the Dividing furious party will believe. And even with Papists themselves we must so far endeavour it, as may justifie us before God and men, that the Division is not caused by us, but by them, and that it is not long of us, but of them, that it continueth unhealed.</p>
               <p>Yet I still profess, that we must not for love of unity, renounce any of Gods truth, nor subscribe to any known error.</p>
               <p>These things premised, I come to tell you what Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do charge the Papists with in matter of Merit; that you may see whether it be any more then I assert: Yet I must advertise you, 1. That it is not all the Papists that our ordinary Writers do lay these charges upon: 2. That I undertake not to prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charge that any Divine shall bring against them, much less to Justifie every angry word, but shall only tell you the charge, and referr you to try and judge of the verity. And to avoid tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of transcribing, I shall for most of them, but cite the places in their writings where you may finde their words.</p>

               <p>Let those Readers that know it not already, observe also that the Papists very much differ about the doctrine of merit among themselves: Insomuch as our Moderate and Learned Divines, do even in the point of Merit of Condignity, take the difference to be but about the very name of Merit, between us and some of them, and not the Thing. Yet even these, whom our Divines use to cite as on our side, do give more, in words at least, to mans works then ever I durst do: For they think the name of merit to be fit, and so do not I: (besides that in their doctrine of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they go yet further and use more unseemly terms then in the former.)</p>

               <p>I Will trouble my self and the Reader with no more of this work. Only that all this be not misused to the further aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens minds from each other, then there is just cause, I say again that 1. All the Papists are not to be charged with the opinion of some: <hi>Soto</hi> and some others deny all merit of Congruity. <hi>Scotus,</hi> and many more Schoolmen and others, deny all merit of Condignity, save what is <hi>ex pacto: (vid. Scot. 1. sent. dist. 17. Q. 2. pag. 108. (Edit. Venet.</hi> 1506.) Some of them, as <hi>Durandus, Ariminensis,</hi> &amp;c. deny all proper merit of Condignity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ex opere</hi> or <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and differ not from Protestants in this, any further then in the use of the name. <hi>Waldensis</hi> is so far against the name it self, that (as he is cited by many of our Divines) he saith, He is the most pious Divine and the best Christian, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no merit at all. And <hi>Contarenus</hi> and <hi>Paulus Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis</hi> are content to go with him: And the rest of the Papists with <hi>Contarenus</hi> that held the conference at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> with our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118986:101"/> Divines, for Reconciliation, did consent to lay by the very word Merit: and ours consented to forbear to say, we are justified by Faith only, and so we and they did wholly agree in the point of Merit.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, I may add that their latter writers, especially the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, do seem more willing to withdraw from the higher sort, and to give less to Merits, then others formerly did. And I can truly say, that of all the Papists that ever I conferred with, I never yet met with two that did not disclaim merit with seeming zeal, and profess to trust in the sole merits of Christs. Though I confess I am jealous that this Reformation is not general in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but calculated to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> because the Jesuites and Priests know that the <hi>odium</hi> of the name of merit, is<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, against</hi> Perkins, <hi>art. de Justific. (in</hi> Wotton, pag. 243.) <hi>saith, We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge very willingly, (as you have heard often before) that every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is Justified freely of the meer Grace of God, through the merit of Christ only, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any merit of the sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
                  </note> a great prejudice to their cause, therefore they do not here indue their proselytes so deeply with this Doctrine: However it be, I am glad it is so for the poor peoples sake. Their late Christian Moderator, mentioneth some late profession of theirs, wherein they profess that by Merit, they mean nothing but <hi>Rewardable:</hi> and Rewardableness no Protestant denyeth.</p>
               <p>Many of them are content to deny the name of merit, to that of Congruity before Conversion. <hi>Petrus à Sancto, Joseph in Suavi Concordia, pro scientia Med. Disput. 1. de Praedest. Sect. 4. pag.</hi> 35, 36, &amp;c. saith, <hi>Assertio 1. Ex communi omnium Catholicorum Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia prima Gratia non datur ex meritis naturalibus ipsius praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinati, sed ex mera Dei liberalitate &amp; miserecordia,</hi> q. d. <hi>initium Iustificationis non esse ex nobis, sed ex Dei Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Franciscus à Sancta clarâ,</hi> is so moderate as to say (<hi>pag. 135, 136. li. Deus natura, Grat.) Non omnis promissio Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta inducit Titulum Iustitiae Promissario: sicut in Scripturis dum promittitur peccatoribvs Remissio si paenituerint, Collatio Remissionis vel primae gratiae, non est ex justitia, secundum omnes; quia requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur solum ut dispositio ad illam, non ut opus sufficiens ad fundandum Justitiam. Justitia ergo oritur ex Conditione solum quae exigit quandam condignitatem operis, non solum aliqualem decentiam operis &amp; operantis.</hi> And indeed most or all of them disclaim this justice in their merit of Congruity. I would they would say plainly, It is no merit at all: and say the like of their merit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:118986:102"/>
               <p>One thing more I would say to prevent misunderstandings, and abuses of others. It will be exceeding necessary for young men, that have not read the Papists themselves, to gather what is their judgement from our most learned, judicious Divines, who knew what they said of them, and were not carried by passion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to wrong them: and not to take all for cerrain that every hot Preacher speaks of them at random; nor that some less ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and more passionate writers do affirm: For, to speak freely and truly, many such there are that are better skilled in wounding then healing, in dividing, then doing our common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against divisions, and in mis-reporting or straining words to the utmost advantage of the enemy of peace.</p>
               <p>If you ask me who those writers be that I would commend to such, as dealing most candidly and truly with the Papists in this point, and from whom a young Schollar may credibly take an estimate of their Doctrine: I <hi>Answ.</hi> Among many others, these seven I would commend to you for this use, as the faithfullest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Popish Doctrine of Merit. <hi>Davenant, de Instit. Actual. Wotton de Reconcil. Chamier, de Merit. in Paustr. Vossius in Thes. de Meritis bon. operum. Camero, Prelect.</hi> &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Field of the Church,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Ʋsher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that I would disparage any other faithful men; but I will name to young men but few.</p>
               <p>And because it will not only shew Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> unworthy dealing with me, but may be a means to keep the younger Schollars from misapprehensions of the true state of the Controversie herein between the Protestants and the Papists, and so may prevent the guilt of much sin many waies, I will here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the words of one of these Divines, (faithfully translated, for the use of the English Reader.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davenant, (de Instit. actuali cap.</hi> 53.) thus opens the state of the Controversie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What the Adversaries hold concerning this, and what is to be held according to the Rule of Verity, I shall next shew. And seeing that on both sides in this Controversie, the Authority of the holy Fathers is wont to be pretended, it will be worth the labour to premise in a few words, what occurreth in them, which may seem to favour either the Adversaries or us: This therefore in the first place must be granted, that the words</hi> merit <hi>and</hi> meriting <hi>are frequently used by the Latine</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:118986:102"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And the like by the Greek Fathers.</note>
                  <hi>Fathers. Hence the Papists, because they often find the word</hi> merit <hi>in the writings of the Fathers, cry out, that they are all against the Protestants. But they make themselves ridiculous, who in a question about the most weighty point of Faith, do rest on one word, and that evilly wrested besides, yea against the mind of all the Fathers. For with the Fathers, To merit, signifieth nothing else, then</hi> To obtain or get some benefit from God, a good work mediating (or being a means thereto). <hi>And merit signifieth with them nothing else, then</hi> A good work ordinated of God to Reward, (<hi>or to be rewarded). Therefore to merit eternal life, is to do those works which according to Gods Ordination are the means of coming to it. If any man will in this sense call the Good Works of the Regenerate merits, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are Ordinated of God to the Reward, and shall say, that the Regenerate do merit life eternal, because, walking in the way of Gods Commandments, they at last, God rewarding them, obtain the Crown of Eternal Glory, in the manner of speaking he agreeth with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and in the thing it self with us, in both he differeth from the Papists.—And if, leaving the Fathers, we descend to the antienter and sounder Schoolmen, we shall finde with them also that this word merit doth denote only works grateful and acceptable, and doth not include either any Condignity to the Reward of eternal life, on the part of the Works, nor Debt on Gods part, according to Justice, properly so called.</hi> Parisiensis in Tract. de Merit. <hi>thus writeth, Of this which is commonly said, that some works are meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and that by every work done in charity, a man deserveth eternal life, it no way seemeth that by the Condignity of any work, a man can deserve eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aquinas, <hi>though he grant merit of Condignity in words,</hi> 1. 2. q. 114. a. 3. <hi>yet indeed he denyeth it, when he excludeth from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit equality of Justice. For he teacheth</hi> ib. a. 1. <hi>Justice is a certain equality; and therefore simply Justice is between them, who have simply an equality.—But in those, in whom Justice is</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid, <hi>and not simply, in them also the reason of merit is not simply.—But it is manifest, that between God and man there is the greatest inequality—and therefore there can be no merit of man with God, but upon presupposition of Divine Ordination; that is, so that man may obtain that of God as a Reward, by his own work, to which God did depute to him the vertue of working. From which words I gather, that</hi> Aquinas <hi>by merit even of Condignity, did mean
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118986:103"/> nothing else, then a work that should obtain the Reward by Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, without equality of value to the Reward, without Debt of Iustice in God to give the Reward. Whence he saith,</hi> fine art. ad 3. <hi>That our action hath not the nature of merit, but upon presupposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Ordination, and that God is not made a Debtor sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to us, but to himself; in as much as it is due that his Ordination be fulfilled.</hi> Durandus, <hi>by a meritorious act understandeth nothing else then an act ordinable to Reward, and expresly denyeth, that merit of Condignity strictly taken, can be in man to God. To these I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate</hi> Scotus, Gregory, Occam, Gabriel, Alfonsus, <hi>and very many other Papists of best note, who professedly taught that the Works of the righteous done by the help of Grace, had yet no intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal Condignity to eternal life, but as to this Reward, they wholly rested on the gracious acceptance and promise of God. We will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have any Controversie with the Fathers, nor with these sounder Schoolmen, about the bare word</hi> merit, (<hi>though it be much better and safer to abstain from this word) but we will contend against the latter Papists, who so defend merit, as that for these works which they call merits, they affirm God himself to be in Iustice a Debtor to men, and do make a Condignity or Equality between these merits of man, and the Reward of Eternal glory.</hi> So far <hi>Davenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if Protestants can so far digest such words of those of <hi>Aquinas</hi> which I cited, by the help of other explications, as to profess that we differ but in words from <hi>him,</hi> (who speaketh more harshly then most of the ancient Schoolmen) I leave it then to the enquiry of the learned, and moderate, what the number of the Papists proportionably may be, that we agree with, or differ from in this point: And if Protestants will have no Controversie with Fathers and such Papists about the bare name of merit, I leave it to consideration, with what peaceableness and sobriety Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> and Mr. <hi>E.</hi> did write, and how like to Protestants they dealt, in making me a Papist, who disclaim the very name of merit: yea, in saying, that the worst of Papists maintain no other merit then I do, who deny all▪ properly so called.</p>
               <p>Learned Dr. <hi>Field</hi> in the Appendix to his third Book of the Church, citeth many Papists, as saying the same with us about▪ Justification and Merit▪ and he approveth even of <hi>Stapletons</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and he there tells us, that the Papists and Protestant-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at the conference at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> fully agreed in the point of

            <p>THere are yet two parts of my task remaining, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, in referrence to the offended Antinomians, before I come to the exceptions of the Orthodox. The first is, to acquaint the world what it is that I call Antinomianism: Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> would perswade men that I mean the Protestant Religion, and that an Antinomian and an Anti-Papist with me are all one. Were it but to convict these men of falshood, I would say nothing to this; it being as needless to impartial men, as to convict a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan of errour: But because I would leave no room for unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly jealousies, nor matter of this kind for unconscionable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriousness to work upon, I will freely declare what are those opinions which I take to belong to the Antinomians, as differing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118986:104"/> from the Protestants: Though as I know every Antinomian holdeth not them all, so I will not call them Antinomians that hold but some of the lesser and more innocent; (though I think the least be very bad.)</p>
            <p>And that what I shall mention are indeed the Antinomists opinions, I appeal to the Reverend Ministers that have conversed with them, especially about <hi>London:</hi> as also to the writings of Dr. <hi>Crispe, Town, Cornwal, Eaton, Den, Saltmarsh,</hi> and the rest well known among us: as also to Mr. <hi>Welds</hi> Rise, Reign, and Ruine of Antinomianism and Familism in New-<hi>England:</hi> as also to the writings of our Divines against them: especially Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that you may see what I hold, as well as what I disclaim, I will give the two extreams in two Columnes, and that which I take to be both the Truth and the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, in the middle.</p>

And we confess that as God hath revealed that he hath elected some determinate persons infallibly to be saved, so he hath revealed his decree to give them faith and new hearts, absolutely, without any proper Condition on their part: And this revelation may be in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral respects called a prediction, a promise, or Covenant: But this is not the Covenant or Law of Grace, which conveyeth pardon, justification and right to glory: None being named in it, or so described, that they can know that it at all belongs to them, nor can plead any right from it, till it be already fulfilled, by the giving of the thing promised. 3. But the New Covenant or Law of Grace which conveyeth Right to impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Salvatian to men, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional properly: and faith and repentance are properly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and no man shall be justified by this Covenant without them. Not that God expecteth that the Elect perform this Condition by the power of Natural Free-will, without his special grace; nor that it is uncertain to God, who will believe: But his Law of Grace as well as of Nature, being his means to rule the world, and to convey salvation to his Elect in a way sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</cell>

               <p>BEcause the great offence that is taken against me, and that hath so exasperated the minds of this sort of men, is my contradicting their Doctrine of Justification; which Doctrine consisteth mainly in these two branches; 1. That the Elect are all Justified from eternity, or from the death of Christ, before they believe: 2. That Justification by Faith, is but in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae,</hi> or in our own feeling, and terminated in conscience, and not in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> (further then conscience may be so called.) I shall therefore▪ here give my Reasons to the Church of God, of my contradicting both these: and I will begin with the latter.</p>
               <p>The thing that I shall prove is this.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>The Justification by Faith, so called in Scriptures, is not the knowledge or feeling▪ of Justification before given, or a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in and by our own consciences, or terminated in conscience, but is somewhat that goes before all such Justification as this is; and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Justification before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may perceive that all this Proposition cannot in terms be concluded in each Argument which I use: But I will suppose my self to deal with the ingenious, that love truth, more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, and come not to pick quarrels, but to understand my meaning: and therefore it shall suffice me, to conclude that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:118986:124"/> which is equipollent, or which is in sense, the thing in Controversie.</p>
               <p>Before I come to Arguments, I must tell you, that the contrary minded are much at a loss among themselves, how to describe their Justification in <hi>foro conscienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and what to make it, and what name to give it; so that some of them seem to be ashamed of the plain terms and dealing of the most, and though they hold the same thing in substance, yet they endeavour to finde new notions for it, and to put a better gloss upon it, then the rude An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians were wont to do.</p>
               <p>Their common description of Justification by Faith, is, that it is the feeling, assurance, or perswasion of Gods love, or of our pardon and former Justification: or actually considered▪ that it is Gods Declaration to our consciences, that we are justified; or consciences justifying of us. And therefore they make Faith, which they call the Instrument of it, to be the belief that we are justified, or, as <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, A perswasion more or less of the Love of God. Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> saith, In foro Divino, <hi>in Gods sight, &amp;c. even while the Elect are unconverted they are then actually justified and freed from all sin by the death of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. 2. In foro conscientiae, <hi>in our own sense: which is but the Revelation and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Declaration of Gods former secret act of accepting Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to our Justification. Vindic. Grat. p.</hi> 21. Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> saith <hi>Quare si quid morte sua nobis impetrat Christus, quod ad peccatorum nostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remissionem attineat sensum istum amoris Divini peccata nostra remittentis nobis impetret necesse est, Vindic. Grat. li. 1. part. 2. §. 25. p.</hi> 272, 273. And if it were but the feeling of pardon that Christ himself purchased, it may well be said that it is no higher matter that Faith receiveth.

                  </gap>mmanent and Transient acts together; and no small number of our own withal, as there described. Some most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judicious men affirm, that God setteth up a Tribunal in the soul, and there first arraigneth and condemneth the sinner, and after justifieth him by his own sentence: and this they will not have to be Justification in <hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> nor done by conscience; but by God, at a certain bar, in the soul, and that is not <hi>forum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatum</hi> neither, but <hi>publicum.</hi> To this I argue, that it can be no other then a fiction: for mans soul is capable of no such thing as they describe▪ except by Enthusiasm, or extraordinary Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whatsoever sentence is revealed to mans soul, the Intellect must be both Passive and Active in it. Yea if it be an Axiom, <hi>Thou</hi> A. B. <hi>art Iustified,</hi> the Intellect is the Agent to gather this from some premises (from Scripture and consciences evidences); or else it is revealed immediately from heaven, into the soul, as Prophesies were to the Prophets: And of how dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it would be, to the comfort of most Christians on earth, to assure them that they are all unjustified, till they are Justified by such a Revelation, is not hard to judge. To this it is replyed to me, that <hi>Gods workings on the soul are secret, and it may be, though we cannot tell how it may be.</hi> To which I say▪ No man more willing to accept of such a Reply then I, if the thing were first proved out of Scripture to be so: But to take it for granted, without proof, that Justification by Faith, is such a Sentence in the soul or conscience, whereof the soul or conscience is not the Author or Actor; and then to say, It may be so, though we know not how, is to me unsatisfactory. Reason must vail to Gods Revelation, but not to mans unproved suppositions: especially when we have so much to say for the contrary. It is past doubt to me, on consideration of so much as is commonly acknowledged concerning the nature of the souls actions, that there can be no such sentence pronounced in man, but man himself must be the pronouncer (excited by God); or else it must be an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm, or immediate Inspiration or Revelation, such as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118986:125"/> had, and man be but the Receiver of it. So that however some by plausible words would put a better face on it, the sense of all seems to be the same, that <hi>Justification by Faith is the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in and by the conscience, that we are formerly Justified:</hi> And so their Justification by Faith, is the same thing that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the Assurance, or knowledge of our Justification, in some degree at least. I prove the contrary.</p>

From <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. and 3. 20. 28. &amp;c. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, shall no flesh be Justified in his sight; Therefore we conclude that a man is Iustified by Faith without the deeds of the Law: For not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law shall be Iustified.</hi> Whence I thus argue, <hi>Such Iustification a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is in Scripture denyed to be attainable by the works of the Law, such is that which is affirmed to be by Faith. But it is another Iustification, distinct from that in conscience,</hi> viz. <hi>Iustification in the sight of God, which is denyed to be attainable by works of the Law. Therefore it is another Iustification;</hi> viz. <hi>in the sight of God, which is affirmed to be by Faith.</hi> The major is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable. The minor is plain in the texts cited also. If any say, Justification in conscience, is Justification in the sight of God; I answer, Its true that God seeth when we are Justified in conscience: but <hi>In the sight of God,</hi> signifieth, <hi>In the Estimation or Iudgement of God:</hi> And if <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> and <hi>Coram Conscientia,</hi> may be distinguished, as by them they are, then we may distinguish them also. All Justification in the sight of God, is not Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in conscience, or in a mans own sight: And where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, yet are they formally distinct things, Many are <hi>Iust before God,</hi> that are not yet just in their own sight, or in the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. From <hi>Rom. 19. 20. That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God: therefore by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be Iustified in his sight.</hi> If it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118986:125"/> be guiltiness before God, from which we are Justified by Faith, then it is Justification before God, which is the Justification by Faith. But the Antecedent is plain in the Text, therefore.</p>
               <p>Though conscience also shall one day be convinced and witness against them, and therefore the Text saith, that every mouth shall be stopped, yet it is of <hi>Guilt before God,</hi> that it is convinced; and this being the <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> of Justification, it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Justification is directly before God, as being the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from guilt before God: Yea in time they are frequently separated: For many a man is guilty before God, long before he stands guilty in the conviction of his own conscience: and so is many a thousand Justified before God, long before they are Justified in their own consciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 3. Rom. 3. 22, 24. Even the Righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi> To be Justified by Faith, is to have the Righteousness of God to be <hi>unto and upon</hi> the Believer: But the righteousness of God is unto and upon Believers usually (if not ever) before they are Justified in their own consciences, therefore. This seems all clearer then to need any further confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 4. Rom. 3. 23, 24. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being Iustified freely by his Grace,</hi> &amp;c. that is, All them that believe, as the foregoing words express. The Justification which is by Faith, is opposed to coming short of the glory of God: The Justification in sense, is opposed to the <hi>sense</hi> of our coming short of the glory of God: therefore the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith is not the same with the Justification in sense (or conscience.) This needs no further confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 5. Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. and 4. 7, 8. <hi>Iustification by Faith, is the same thing (or at least, of the same nature of action) with forgiveness of sin, covering sin, and not imputing sin by the Lord: But these are distinct things, and separable from Iustification in sense or conscience, therefore.</hi> Many a mans iniquities are forgiven that knows it not; and are covered as to God, that are bare as to themselves. God imputeth not every mans sin to him, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Gods non-imputation. Those whom I dispute against, do commonly grant that this non-imputation of sin is not the same thing with Justification in conscience: But it is the same thing with Justification by Faith, as is put past all doubt in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118986:126"/> Text; therefore Justification by Faith, and in sense or conscience are not all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 6. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. 5. 6. 9. 11. 22, 23, 24. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>believed God, and it was counted unto him for Righteousness: But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteousness. Even as</hi> David <hi>also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness without Works. For we say that faith was reckoned to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>for Righteousness. And he received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had yet being uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: that he might be the Father of all them that believe, that righteousness might be imputed to them also. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness: Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him: But for us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6. and <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>From all these I thus argue: Justification by Faith is the same thing with Gods Imputing righteousness to us, or imputing Faith for righteousness: Justification in sense or conscience, is not the same thing with Gods imputing righteousness, or Faith for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: therefore Iustification by Faith is not the same thing with Iustification in sense or conscience.</p>
               <p>The Major is as true as Gods Word. The Minor is yielded by those that I dispute against, commonly. They suppose that Gods Imputing righteousness to us, is at Christs death, or before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: though the Scripture expresly contradict them. Nay hence I may further argue thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. From the forecited Texts. If Iustifying Faith be not the Believing that we are already Justified or the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or feeling of our Justification or pardon, then Justification by that Faith is not Justification in sense or conscience: But the former is true: therefore so is the latter.</p>
               <p>I prove the Antecedent thus; Believing, or knowing, or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are Justified or pardoned, doth follow Justification or pardon: Justifying Faith doth not follow, but go before Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pardon; therefore believing that we are justified, is not Justifying Faith.</p>
               <p>If they say, It goeth before Justification by Faith, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Justification from eternity, or at Christs death; I answer,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118986:126"/> Scripture mentioneth no such thing as the latter, which they say, it followeth: However it must be confessed that it is not this Justification which the Apostle speaks of in all this discourse; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4. which goeth before Faith. For 1. Else it could not be a Justification by Faith; 2. Faith it self is imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in that Iustification which is by Faith: But Faith must exist before it can be imputed for righteousness. And further consider, the Faith which they describe doth not exist, before Faith is imputed to us for righteousness: Faith is imputed for righteousness before a man doth believe that he is already Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: therefore Iustification by Faith goeth before their Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in conscience.</p>
               <p>If any say, that it is not Faith it self, but Christ that is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteousness: I answer, 1. In some sense Faith it self is imputed, else the Apostle would never say it, and say it so oft as he doth: and we are not now on a discussion of the sense▪ but in what sense soever it be, Faith must exist before it be imputed as the Apostle saith it is. 2.

It is as plain in the Apostles words, as the tongue of man can speak it, that it is Faith that is imputed for righteousness, and not only Christ believed in. Which I undertake to make clear on any fit occasion, to any man that is truly willing to know the Truth, and of competent capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in such matters. In the mean time, see but what Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconcil.</hi> hath said, and <hi>John Goodwin</hi> of Justification, and see how Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> on <hi>John, pag.</hi> 453. clears it from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. and 9. 8.

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 8. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5. Justification by Faith is a Reckoning the Reward to a man of Grace: Justification in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is not a reckoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To reckon the Reward to him, is to adjudge it to him, or to judge him to have a Right in it, or to give him that Right in it, of meer Grace, and not to give him the knowledge or sense of his former Right.</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 9. From. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 14. Justification by Faith, is the same thing as making us heirs by Promise, through the righteousness of Faith. But to be made an heir by Promise, through the righteousness of Faith, is not the same thing as to know, feel, or believe that we are justified, or to be justified in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: therefore.</p>
               <p>Many a man is made an heir, that is not certain of it, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth it: and if he did believe it, yet to be made an heir is one thing, and to feel or believe it is another. The Promise also doth first convey Right to us, and that it may do long before we apprehend that we are the persons that have that Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 10. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. Justification by Faith goeth before our having Peace with God, and our having access into the Grace wherein we stand; Justification in conscience doth not go before our having Peace with God, and access to that Grace wherein we stand: therefore Justification by Faith is not the same as Iustification in conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 11. Rom. 5. 16. The free gift is of many offences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iustification;</hi> The Justification that <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, is the free gift of Remission of many offences: but this goeth before Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in conscience: therefore the Iustification that <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, goeth before Iustification in conscience: Gods gift of Remission must go before the knowledge or belief of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 12. Rom. 5. 17. Much more they which receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteousness, shall reign, &amp;c.</hi> The Iustification by Faith, and which <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, is the gift of Righteousness: Iustification in conscience is not the gift of righteousness, but the knowledge or sense that righteousness is given us: therefore.</p>
               <p>Here you have the true nature of Iustification by Faith. It is Gods giving us righteousness (Remission of sin through Christs blood), on our believing. To give righteousness goes before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of it, or comfort in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 13. From <hi>Rom. 5. 18. Therefore as by the offence of one, Iudgement came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the Righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to Iustification of life.</hi> The Iustification which <hi>Paul</hi> means, and is by Faith, is the Iustification of life, and opposed to condemnation by Gods
<pb n="997" facs="tcp:118986:127"/> Iudgement. Iustification in sense or conscience is not so, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it: therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>By Iustification of life, is meant the giving or adjudging of life to us: But assurance or knowledge that it is given us, follows the gift, and is not properly the Iustification of life, but the Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 14. From <hi>Rom. 5. 19. For as by one mans disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one, shall many be made righteous:</hi> Hence I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Iustification in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and which is by Faith, is a making men righteous: Iustification in feeling or conscience, is not a making men righteous, but followeth it; therefore. Iustification in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and which is by Faith, is not the same with Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in feeling or conscience.</p>
               <p>The Major is in the text, and context: The Minor is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them that I dispute against. To declare to a man that he is righteous, is not to make him righteous, but followeth it; If it be a true Declaration, the thing must be true in order before it be Declared true. By making righteous, I do not mean (nor doth the text) as the Papists do, a making us conformable to the Moral Law of God, by sanctification; nor yet the giving us the vertue of particular Iustice, whereby we give every man his own; but the Text by <hi>making us righteous,</hi> means, <hi>making us not guilty of death,</hi> which is done by remitting our guilt, the Condition of Remission (Faith) being first given us.</p>
               <p>From this text and some of the rest before cited, I commend to the Readers consideration, whether it be not evident that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive<note place="margin">☜</note> Iustification, or making us righteous, be not that first Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, which Scripture mentioneth? And hereby, 1. I would convince those of a mistake, that so precisely tye the word <hi>Iustification</hi> to signifie a sentence of Iudgement, that they affirm that this is the Iustification, yea the only Iustification by Faith, that the Scripture mentioneth? Whereas it is a <hi>making us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> means, which is done by the Promise, or Legal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Condonation, and goes before the Sentence; and may it self be well called <hi>Sententia Legis,</hi> and that far better then we may so speak of the Laws of men (as I could shew by clear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;) and it is Virtually the Sentence of God as Iudge (at least.) I confess that Iustification most strictly signifieth the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118986:128"/> Sentence: But it is plain that in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles it signifieth more frequently the Sentence of the New Law.</p>
               <p>2. Let the Reader here judge, whether Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> reviling me as a deluding Papist, for distinguishing between Constitutive and Sentential Justification, as having no ground in Scripture▪ did more credit the Papists, or himself, and were any wiser and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster then the rest of his book? 1 I might have disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But yet he may easily see both branches of the Distinction in many texts of Scripture, and particularly Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Justification is in this, if making or Constituting righteous be Justifying, as the terms, and the foregoing 18. <hi>verse</hi> do shew that it is. Here is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. And he that hateth and curseth every man that saith to the wicked Thou art righteous, and that Justifieth the wicked; will undoubtedly make a man righteous before he sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or declare him righteous.</p>
               <p>And for the other branch of the distinction, if I must prove that there is such a thing as Justification by sentence in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (that is, that there is a Judgement and a Sentence,) and it be not enough to prove that we shall be judged by Christ, who shall come to Iudge the quick and the dead; to omit many more, I only now refer such a man to <hi>Math. 12. 36, 37. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Iudgement. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned; viz.</hi> in that day of Iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 15. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2. The Iustification which <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, freeth us from the Law of sin and death, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in feeling or conscience, freeth us but from the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conscience, and inward disquiet of minde; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>It will prove a dangerous Doctrine, to teach that God doth make internal Declarations the Instrument of conveying right to his favours, or the foundation of our Right, and so lead men
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118986:128"/> from that sure Word which is the Instrument and foundation. The obligation of the Law which is dissolved by Justification, is an Act of Law, whether we feel it or not; and not an act of conscience, nor alwayes there felt: therefore it must be an act of Law, that must dissolve that obligation (to punishment) and not an act of conscience, nor an act upon conscience, as such. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 16. From <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he called, them he also Justified, and whom he Justified, them he also Glorified.</hi> The Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, and is by Faith, belongeth to all the called: The Justification in feeling or in conscience, belongs not to all the called: therefore they are not one kinde of Justification. I shall say more to this also anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 17. From <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Iustifieth; Who is he that condemneth?</hi> The Iustification that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, is opposed to mans Accusation, as that which it freeth us from, as to the effect of it: But so is not the Iustification in feeling or conscience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not all one.</p>
               <p>It is not in our Consciences that men Accuse us: they have no Access thereto: they lay no charge there against us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 18. From the same place. The Iustification that <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, is opposed to condemnation by any man whomsoever: But so is not Iustification in conscience; therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 19. From <hi>Rom. 11. 30. The Gentiles which followed not after Righteousness, have attained to Righteousness, even the Righteousness which is of Faith.</hi> The Iustification which <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, is attaining to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. Iustification in <hi>foro Conscientiae</hi> is not an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Righteousness, but to the knowledge or apprehension that we are righteous: therefore they are not the same Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 20. From <hi>Rom. 10. 4, 10. For Christ is the end of the Law, for righteousness, to every one that Believeth. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is made unto salvation.</hi> The Iustification that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, is a becoming righteous upon our believing, Christ being then

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 22. From <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 9. All that have the blessing Promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the faithful with him, are justified in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and by Faith. All that have that blessing are not Iustified in <hi>foro Conscientiae:</hi> therefore they are separable, and oft separated, and not the same.

               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 23. From <hi>Gal. 3. 11. But that no man is Iustified by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident; for the just shall live by Faith.</hi> Iustification by Faith, and in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, is the life of the just, and is in the sight of God: Iustification in <hi>foro Conscientiae,</hi> is not such, but followeth it; therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 24. From <hi>Gal. 3. 21, 22. Is the Law then against the Promises of God? God forbid? For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the Promise by Faith of Iesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</hi> From these words I may raise divers Arguments, One is from the Instrument, and foundation of the Relation, <hi>the Law; the Promise.</hi> Iustification in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and by Faith, is such as the Promise doth give, and the Law would have given, if it could have given Life. Iustification in <hi>foro Conscientiae</hi> is not this, but a consequent of it: therefore.</p>
               <p>For the Major, that the Text speaks of Justification, is evident in those words, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ghteousness should have been by the Law.</hi> For the Minor, it is confessed by the most learned of mine Antagonists, whose main plea is, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t justification is only the Sentence of the Judge, and not of the Law or Promise. And in the thing it self
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118986:129"/> it is evident, in that to assure the conscience, is a separable effect▪ that alway follows not the Law or Promise: but to convey Legal right to the benefit conferred, is an inseparable effect, as soon as the Promise acteth and is effectual. This shews also that <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 25. From the same words I argue thus. Justification in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and by Faith, is either the giving of life, or an act of the same nature: Justification in conscience is not so, but is the giving of Assurance, knowledge or sense that life is before given us: therefore they be not all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 26. From the same words I argue thus. Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, and by Faith, is opposite to the concluding men under sin: Iustification in conscience is not so, but is opposite to the knowledge or sense of our being concluded under sin, or to the concluding our selves under sin; and not to Gods concluding them under it by Law: therefore they are not all one.</p>

The Iustification that <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, and is by Faith, is that which followeth, being found in Christ, and consisteth in not having a righteousness of the Law of our own, but having the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of Christ by Faith. The Iustification in conscience is not such; but is our knowledge that we are in Christ, and have his righteousness, which is by Faith: therefore.</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 33. From <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. Iustification in <hi>Iames</hi> his sense, was such as salvation depended on, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. and as consisted in Gods Imputation, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. Iustification in conscience, is not so, but is only the Declaration of this to our selves; therefore they are not the same.</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 34. From <hi>Iohn 1. 11, 12. As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name.</hi> Adoption, which is an act of the same nature with Iustification, and concomitant, if not part of it, doth not consist in a Declaration to our consciences that we are sons; but in giving power, or Authority to become sons: (which is by the Promise or Law of Grace, and not by sentence internal or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:118986:130"/> therefore Justification in Christs sense here, and which is by Faith, consisteth not in a Declaration to our consciences, that we are righteous, but in giving us power, Priviledge, or Authority to become righteous. The Reason is the same.</p>

                  </gap>ustification <hi>in foro Conscientiae</hi> that is the Iustification by Faith which the Scripture treats of. But the Antecedent is true therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
               <p>The Consequence of the Major is proved thus: The Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, which Scripture treats of, (at least commonly, if not ever, as I suppose, when it excludeth all works) is the first Iustification by Faith, or of the same sort, and not any following sort, overpassing the first: therefore the Consequence is good. I know but one man, if any, that denyeth this; or that affirmeth it is only a second Iustification of a different sort from the first,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118986:131"/> that Scripture meaneth by <hi>Iustification by Faith:</hi> nor is there any probability that our first Iustification by Faith should be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced and passed over, and a second (of a far lower nature) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or usually mentioned, without it! When I know any to dispute against, I shall easily prove what in this I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.</p>
               <p>And for the Antecedent (that there is a Iustification by Faith in point of Law or Right, before that of conscience) I prove it thus: No man is by God, or a well informed conscience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sonally, actually just, before he be personally actually just indeed: But no man is personally actually just indeed but by Faith: therefore.</p>
               <p>The Major is plain, in that God and a well informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science declare nothing but the truth: But if they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be personally actually just, that is not so, they should declare an untruth: therefore.</p>
               <p>I say <hi>personally and actually</hi> just; because it is not righteousness as it is in Christ only▪ not made ours, nor our persons thereby yet righteous, that can justifie us, that have it not in Right: 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not a righteousness meerly potential, or <hi>in Causa,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an justifie us actually.</p>
               <p>And for the Minor, that none is so just but by Faith, almost all the Scriptures forecited prove, with many more: <hi>Without Faith it is impossible to please God. Heb. 11. 6. The just shall live by Faith. It is the righteousness which is by faith; and faith that is imputed for righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. Here the common subterfuge, is by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the case of Infants, which have not Faith. To which I still say, 1. That our discourse is supposed, and to be of the aged, and the case of infants obscure: and so is the Scripture it self to be understood, unless you will say, all dying in Infancy are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 2. Infants are righteous by Christ upon their Parents Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
               <p>The ordinary opposers have nothing that I know of against all this that I have said; but two learned men that have more wit then the rest, have each of them an objection. The first saith, that the first Iustification by Faith is indeed by the moral Act of the Law of Grace or Promise, but it is nevertheless terminated in conscience; for it is conscience which the Promise
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118986:131"/> speaks to and assures. To which I say, as I did before: The act of the Promise, Law or Grant, constituting Right, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Title, Remitting the Obligation to Punishment, in it self is totally distinct from the act of declaring this to our selves which is said to be terminated in conscience, and is before it, and may be without it. A man may by the Princes Grant, be made free, or noble, before he know it; and so may a Traytor be actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned before he know it, seeing the Princes pardon doth remit the Guilt, and Constitute a Right to Impunity, before it notifie this to the offendor, at least in order of nature, if not of time.</p>
               <p>The other objecteth, that its undenyable that men are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Iust, or pardoned by the Covenant or Promise, before they are Iustified in conscience: but it is not the former, but the latter▪ that is called in Scripture, Iustification, seeing Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ever <hi>sententia Iudicis,</hi> and not <hi>Legis.</hi> To which I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have fully proved the contrary before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods Laws are such, that in some of them may be said <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis partes agere</hi> in some measure, as well as <hi>Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sententia Legis,</hi> is a common phrase, and though not so proper as <hi>Sententia Iudicis,</hi> yet here it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What means the Scripture to talk so much of Iustification by the Law, and to yield that the Law would Justifie us, could it have given life, or were it not weak through the Flesh? And Iustification by Christ and the Promise, is opposed to Iustification by the Law: It is plain therefore, that its primarily of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Law sense or Right that <hi>Paul</hi> treateth, and secondarily or consequentially of Iustification, by sentence at Iudgement, (which is also oft mentioned directly;) but never that I can find doth he once call that Iustification, which is but the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our righteousness, to or by our consciences.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:118986:132"/>5. At the utmost, all is granted us by this objection, save the name. For it is confessed that we are by Faith made righteous, (by Christs satisfaction, and Merit, as the deserving Cause, and by Remission of sin as the thing) before we are justified in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: And to say we are made righteous, but not justified, is to be more or less accurate then Scripture, or then <hi>Grammarians</hi> are: Though we confess that there is a sentential Justification, after making righteous. I would not therefore make any more debate about the name <hi>Justification,</hi> when the thing is granted, were it not that by this advantage, the Erroneous will interpret all the texts that use the word Iustification, of Iustification in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science only, to the no small wrong of the Scripture, themselves and others. I must be shorter in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. In the Iustification in conscience, man justifieth himself, or is the true efficient cause of that his Iustification. In the Iustification by Faith, which <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, man doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie himself, nor is any true efficient cause of it: therefore they are not the same kind of Iustification.</p>
               <p>The Major is undenyable, at least, if it be not an Enthusiasm, which they speak of, such as the Prophets Revelations were: such an act as knowledge is, such is conscience. <hi>Omne Conscire, est scire.</hi> If it were proved that <hi>Intelligere est tantum pati &amp; non agere,</hi> and so that the Intellect were a meer patient in receiving its part, yet Intellection is but an Introductive act or passion: that is more fully said to be done to or on the man, which reacheth the heart: and in that the Intellect must be Active, or else the order of the natural operation of mans soul must be subverted▪ If the Will or Affections be moved by supernatural Truths or Matters, and not by the action and meditation of the intellect, it will not be <hi>actus bumanus,</hi> not a rational act. But Iustification by Faith is not such, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. Iustification in conscience, or in any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the soul, is of divers Degrees, at first: (for ought I know as different as there be persons;) one justified more, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther less: Iustification by Faith in <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> sense, is in all men at their first believing, in the same measure: therefore they are not the same Iustification.</p>
               <p>The Major is undoubted; 1. From Christian experience: 2. From the nature of the thing, and quality of our faculties,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:118986:132"/> which God makes use of in that sort of Iustification. So that it is as needless to prove it further, as to prove that one man knows more then another, or that one man lives more comfortably then another, or hath more assurance.</p>
               <p>The Minor is commonly granted by Protestants. Our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at our first believing, is in the Remission of sins past: and all mens sins are equally remitted; all men have equal right to impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and equal right to glory. The conclusion therefore must needs follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Iustification in conscience may rise and fall in degrees every day in the same persons: Justification by faith in Scripture sense, doth not so: therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>The Major needs no proof, but consulting the common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our selves and others. What man hath the same know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and feeling of Gods Love, or the pardon of sin, one time as at another: yea or long together? To whose soul doth God declare Remission of sins, every day, and at all times alike?</p>
               <p>The Minor is commonly acknowledged by those that I dispute against: Only some may question whether I hold it my self; which I have spoke enough to before. Iustification by Faith in Scripture sense may be said to be increased as to the addition of new sins remitted, which were not remitted before; or as to the degree of Castigatory punishment remitted: but not as to the nature of the act of Remission, nor as to the right to eternal life (though Iustification by sentence be yet of a higher kind:) But Iustification in conscience, is increased in the very nature of the thing: And as it may rise, so may it fall again▪ many times a day. But Iustification by faith, is not changed according to every change in our apprehensions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 5. A man is not actually justified in conscience, when he is a sleep, or wholly taken up with other thoughts (and then I doubt most of us, live unjustified the far greater part of our lives:) But a man is justified by faith, when he is a sleep, and wholly taken up with other thoughts: therefore these are not one sort of Iustification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 6▪ Iustification in consc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence is frequently lost and repaired again: Iustification by saith, in Scripture sense, is not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118986:133"/> frequently (nor at all) lost and repaired again: therefore they are not the same sort of Iustification. The Major is proved by the common experience of Christians; who sometime (at least many) do quite lose all Apprehensions of the pardon of their own sin▪ and of Gods special love to them: The Minor is commonly maintained by our Divines against the Arminians, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans and Papists (save only that <hi>Davenant,</hi> and some others, and it seems the Sinod of <hi>Dort,</hi> excepted infant Justification from being not-loseable) But we speak of that of actual Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. Justification in conscience is not enjoyed by every true Believer. Justification by Faith is enjoyed by every true Believer: Therefore they are not the same. For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, I appeal to experience: The Minor is past question.</p>
               <p>Only I must answer one great objection against the Major, which may be made. <hi>Obj.</hi> Whoever believeth, taketh Christ for his Saviour, and Believeth the Promise of Pardon and salvation: and therefore he must needs believe that Christ is his Saviour, and consequently his Justifier: and that there is a Promise of his pardon and salvation. <hi>Answ.</hi> Whoever believeth to Justification, believeth that Christ is the Saviour, having made himself a sacrifice for sin▪ and received power to pardon: also that God offereth Christ to him as well as others: and also that there is a Promise of salvation made through Christ to all that will believe sincerely, and therefore to him, if he so believe: He also consenteth unfeignedly that Christ should be his Lord and Saviour on the terms that he is offered on. And he that goes thus far, believeth to Justification. But this same man that doth thus believe, may be ignorant that he doth believe sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Justification in Conscience, is a thing that a true Believer may not only live without, but die without: Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith is no such thing: therefore they are not the same: 1. Experience tells us of Godly people that have dyed without the former (<hi>immo qui nece violenta s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 9. Iustification in conscience doth not evermore immediately and inseparably accompany Iustifying, or true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith: Iustification by faith doth evermore immediatly and inseparably accompany such a faith: therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 10. No Infants are Iustified in conscience; All the Infants of Believers that are in a state of salvation, have that Iustification which is by faith; therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>To prove the Major, there needs no more then to prove that they have not the use of reason; for if they do not <hi>scire,</hi> they do not <hi>conscire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Minor is proved thus; 1. It is the same Promise that is<note place="margin">I would not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the case of Infants in any of the obscurer points, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I refer you for this, to what I have said in my Book of Baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Infants stand accused and condemned by a Law; therefore they must be discharged and justified by a Law, or Promise as well as others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Infants have no Promise of pardon, then what differ they from the Infants of Heathens.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if there be no Promise of their pardon, who can tell that any of them ever are pardoned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Or who can Baptize them for Remission of sin. All this I say, as to them that say, infants and all the Elect are justified in Christ when he satisfied; and this may save them that are not

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. Infants have no other kinde of Right to Christ, then the aged have, upon the meer payment of the price, before a further conveyance. But the aged are not in a state of Iustification or salvation by it before further conveyance: therefore Infants are not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Else according to this Doctrine, why may we not say that Heathen Indians are saved by Christ, as well as Christians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? For they are not called to believe in Christ any more then Infants: And either Infants of Believers have some Promise of pardon, more then the Heathens that never heard the Gospel, or they have not: If they have no more Promise, then we must say alike of them, that either both may be Elect, and so Justified in Christ without Faith or Promise; or that neither are Elect, justified or saved. If there be a Promise to our Infants of pardon, more then to those Pagans; then I have what I seek: <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants have a Justification in Law or by Promise, distinct from that in conscience, and from the benefit which flows from Christs death, meerly as a price paid and accepted, without a further Conveyance of a special Right, which all have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 11. Justification in conscience, is but a Declaration or knowledge that we were actually justified (or made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) before. Justification by Faith in Scripture-sense is not so, but the making us first actually righteous: therefore they are divers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 12. Justification in conscience freeth us but from the Accusation, Condemnation, and Consequent terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and not from the effect of Satans, and the Laws Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations before God, nor from Gods Condemnation. Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, in the Scripture sense, freeth us from these latter, and not alwaies from the former: therefore they are not the same. Our salvation depends on our Justification by Faith in Law, or before God (as many Scripture shew): but our salvation doth not depend on the knowledge of this, and of Justification in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118986:134"/> It is only our comfort that dependeth on that Our peace with God is the attendant of one, and our peace of conscience of the other. Justification in conscience (commonly, and more fitly called Assurance, or some degree of the knowledge of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) is a great mercy, and highly to be valued. But compared to our Justification by Faith in Right and before God, it is small and inconsiderable: differing from it as much as a mans present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort differs from his safety and eternal salvation. He that liveth sadly here, may dye well and live happily hereafter.</p>
               <p>Or take the Argument thus. Justification in conscience dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the Laws obligation to punishment: Justification, or pardon of sin in Law-sense by Faith, doth dissolve the Laws obligation to punishment: therefore they are not the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 13. Justification by conscience is by a fallible and unauthorised Judge (as to any certain decision): Justification by Faith is, by God the supream, rightful, infallible Judge; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are divers. I know nothing by my self saith <hi>Paul,</hi> yet am not thereby justified: there is one that Judgeth, even the Lord: Hereby he expresseth that conscience hath not authority of Decision for life and death, but of Discretion for comfort or discomfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 14. Men may be justified in conscience by other Graces as well as by Faith, and in the same kind and rank, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate with it, if not without any consideration of it. (for he that can find Love, Hope, true Humility, &amp;c. may receive the knowledge of Gods Love by them by way of evidence, as well as by Faith) But Justification by Faith is in a special and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal manner by Faith; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118986:135"/> Justification by Faith which you plead for. Furthermore, your belief that you are justified in Christ, is either such an act as all ought to perform, or not: If it be, then either most must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an untruth, or else it is only some common Justification that you mean, which all are partakers of: but that is not it in question now. If not, then either you have some ground more then others in Gods Word, for to bottom your Faith of particular Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ upon, or not: If you have, either that Scripture nameth you (which it doth not) or it describeth you as a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied person distinct from others by some qualification by which you may know your self. But this it doth not: and to assert such qualifications before Faith, to which Iustification is annexed, is Pelagianism, or worse. If you have no grounds in Gods Word to bottom your particular belief on, which all have not, then 1. Your particular belief is confessed not to be grounded on the Word, and then I had rather it were yours, then mine: at least, I durst not trust to it. 2. Then it must have the very nature of an Immediate Euthusiasm or Revelation from Heaven: and if you say, you have such, I will not deny it; but if you say; All the justified by Faith have such, I shall not believe you in the least, without better proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 15. If Justification by Faith, be Justification in conscience, then Justification is a part of Sanctification (which is the work of the Spirit making a Real change on the soul.) But Justification by Faith is not a part of Sanctification. Therefore it is not Justification in conscience.</p>
               <p>The Minor is undenyed. The consequence of the Major is proved from the description of them both: Sanctification is the Real mutation on the Intellect and Will; on the Intellect, it is Illumination, acquainting us with Divine verities; On the Will, it is the entertainment of these as good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Justification in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is Gods illuminating our understandings to see the Truth of our Condition, that we are righteous; and the affecting the heart to Rejoyce herein; both are a real change, and an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereas Protestants have taken Justification hitherto to be a Relative change, and distinguished it from Sanctification, and that in this respect. (Though executive Remission be a Real change.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 16. If the Faith whereby we are justified in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118986:135"/> sense, be not the same act of Faith, with that whereby we are supposed to be justified in conscience, then the Justifications are not the same: But the Antecedent is true; therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
               <p>The Antecedent (which only requireth proof) is proved by the description of each of them. The Faith whereby they feign that we are Justified in conscience, is, say they, a particular belief that my own sins are pardoned; or that I am justified, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Christs righteousness, or that I am Elect: Or a perswasion of this; or an Assurance of it. The Faith whereby we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Scripture-sense, is a believing the Gospel, and that Christ is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and an accepting of him as he is offered in the Gospel: It is a receiving of Christ Jesus the Lord: <hi>As many as received him, to them he gives this power; Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Or it is a believing in or on Christ for Iustification and pardon, and not a believing that we are pardoned already. The conclusion therefore cannot be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 17. If Iustification by Faith, be that in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and such as the most learned maintainers of it affirm (that is, an immediate supernatural Declaration of God to the soul, that it is absolved, without our own discourse to collcct it by way of Conclusion from other Premises) then the duty of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to try whether we be in the Faith, and whether Christ be in us, seems vain: But the Consequent is unsound: therefore so is the Antecedent. The reason of the Consequence is here, where God immediately by supernatural Revelation declareth to a man that he is justified, there is no use for his own reasonings and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection thereto: No more then of a Candle at noon: for Gods immediate Declaration is the fullest testimony: especially if it be so convincing and deciding as the maintainers do affirm it. But all that are Justified by Faith, according to them, have these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, or Declarations from heaven: therefore to all believers do they make examination useless: which yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 18. If God justifie all Believers by such an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation or Declaration to conscience (or any the like) then Iustification may be felt, and discerned <hi>in se,</hi> as sanctification may, and not only in and by its signs, causes, effects, concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants▪ But the contrary hath hitherto been the Doctrine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118986:136"/> who have taught that election and Iustification cannot be discerned in themselves but only by the signs, as sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 19. That Doctrine is not true, which contradicteth the experience of the Generality of the Godly, in a case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their experience is fit for decision. But this Doctrine (of the most learned of that way) that Justification by Faith, is such an immediate Declaration to the conscience or soul, without the use of mans reasoning to collect it, is contradictory to the experience of the generality▪ (the most) of the Godly, (of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so far as I can learn): therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sure I am, I know not my self of any witness or Declaration of God to my soul▪ which was not in the natural way of discourse, (though super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally excited, assisted and succeeded); the Intellect recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the objective <hi>Species,</hi> and seeing a Reason for the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Premises: and not that ever I knew any Conclusion, which is revealed neither in nature, Scripture, nor by humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, without knowing the Premises, and how it riseth from them. Yet I confess I have experience of strange unusual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Light, and very suddenly, when I least expected it: but it is only in a Revelation of Conclusions from Premises, shewing me suddenly the reason of things which I observed not, or sought after before in vain. But never found I an immediate Revelation, Euthusiasm, or Vision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 20. That Doctrine is not to be embraced which tends directly to the deluding of fanatick, proud and melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons, and to drive all sober Christians, or most, to unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able despair; But such is this Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>The reasons why I judge that the Elect are not justified from Eternity, nor at Christs death, nor while they are Infidels or impenitent. And that we did not Merit or satisfie justice in Christ; but he did it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Mediator.</hi>

               <p>HAving (I think) proved that the Justification by Faith,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> that Scripture speaks of, is not the same thing which they call Justification <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> or Gods Declaration to the soul, or sentence in the soul that we are just or pardoned, I am next to prove that we are not justified from eternity, or from the death of Christ. The former as distinct from the latter, I will speak of but briefly, and then speak to both conjunctly.</p>
               <p>1. The Elect are not justified from Eternity: I prove it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. To be justified, is either to be made just; or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed to be just, or maintained by Apologie to be just, or esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed just, or sentenced just. But the Elect are in none of all these senses justified from eternity: therefore not at all.</p>
               <p>Yet I deny not but a man may, if he will speak unfitly, put the name of Iustification upon some act that is eternal, and then if he so say, we are justified from eternity, the thing that he meaneth is true; though the words in the proper sense are false? For the Major, if they have any other fit sense of the word Iustification, when we know it, we shall know what to say to it. For Dr. <hi>Twis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Non punire, &amp; Nolle punire,</hi> I have said enough in another writing to it. To which I will now add but this. Should we grant
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:118986:137"/> that Remission of sin may be expressed by those terms; it must be on supposition of the existence of a Capable object: that is, that it be about a guilty person. For as it is Essential to <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that it be <hi>propter peccatum,</hi> for a fault (real, or mistakingly judged so, at least), and if it be otherwise, it is but Affliction and no Punishment: So is it essential to any. <hi>Non punire,</hi> or <hi>Nolle pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> which may be called Remission, that the party be guilty who is the object. Yea and that it be an act of God as Rector, of mankinde: (or Angels in their case.) Otherwise God might be said to justifie or pardon a stone or a tree from eternity, because he doth <hi>Non punire,</hi> not punish them, and <hi>Nolle punire,</hi> resolve not to punish them. Now God was not Rector of the Rational Creature, before the creature did exist; that is past doubt: And as certain is it that man was not guilty from Eternity. If it be said that if sufficeth that his guilt had an <hi>esse cognitum</hi> in God; I answer, when that is proved, I will believe it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the guilt hath but an <hi>esse cognitum,</hi> so the Remission can have no higher a nature, and therefore not have an <hi>esse Reale:</hi> Nay it implyeth a denyal of Real existence in both: For as the <hi>esse cognitum</hi> of the guilt, is but Gods foreknowledge that it will be, or his knowledge that it is future, so his Will not to punish, is but a Drcree to Remit that guilt, when it is guilt indeed; and is no Remission of it from eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A purpose to punish, is no obligation to punishment, nor makes it due: therefore a purpose not to punish, is no Remission of any such dueness or obligation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Foreknowledge is an immanent act, that puts nothing in the object: therefore it makes it not guilty, nor removeth guilt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is manifest injustice among men, to suppose a man guilty and capable of pardon or punishment meerly because it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known that he will offend, if any could foreknow it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Foreknowledge makes no man immediately capable of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore it makes him not capable of pardon.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, 1. That we are not constituted just from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity needs no proof. 2. That we are not witnessed, maintained by Plea▪ or sentenced just, need no proof neither. I know none that will affirm them. The only doubt is, whether God esteem us not just, or accept us as just from eternity? But this is answered sufficiently already, and especially in my Reply to Mr. <hi>Kendal.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:118986:137"/>
               <p>1. The most learned deny that Gods secret estimation is any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification or pardon, nor so to be called. 2. If it were, it must be the estimation of God as Rector of mankinde: but he is not Rector from eternity. 3. God esteemeth not that to be true which is false, nor men to be what they are not: therefore he esteemeth not men to be guilty before they are guilty, nor just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are just: <hi>Ob.</hi> God esteemeth us just in time: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he so esteemed us from eternity, because esteeming is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent act in God. <hi>Answ.</hi> According to the commonly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine in these high points, we must say, that as it is but <hi>Denominatione ex trinseca,</hi> or <hi>Relatione Rationis,</hi> at most: That Gods Acts of Approving and Disapproving, esteeming just, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjust, are diversified and distinguished; so in the same respects they may and must be said to begin and end according to their objects, without any change in God. And therefore we must say that God esteemeth men just, when they are just, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; For the same Act or Essence of God, which before was only denominated, A foreknowing that we would be just, was not to be denominated, An esteeming us to be just, till we are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. So much for that Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If we are justified from eternity, then we are justfied without Christs satisfaction as the cause of it. But we are not Justified without Christs satisfaction as the cause: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Major is evident, in that Christs satisfaction was not from eternity, and therefore could not cause from eternity. Nor was there any effect from eternity to be caused by it; Gods imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts are commonly said to be God himself; and Christs Merits did not cause God himself. They whom I oppose, say, that Christs death causeth only the <hi>Rem Volitam, at non Actum volen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> They cannot say, therefore, as in the foregoing case, that it causeth <hi>in esse Cognito:</hi> or if they did, the same answer will seem fitting to this case, besides what is now said. But I need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend where I have no adversary.</p>
               <p>The Minor I should think most Christians should confess▪ Without Blood there is no Remission: It is Christ that is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world What need his blood be shed for the Remission of sins, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from eternity? to do that which was done before. That
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118986:138"/> Doctrine which supposeth 1. That God was so prodigal of his Sons blood and sufferings. 2. That there was no more need of the sufferings and Merits of Christ, then to manifest what was done from eternity. 3. That no Elect man was ever guilty no not <hi>Adam</hi> himself upon his fall (unless he could be guilty, and not guilty at once) 4. That we are no more beholden to Christ, then for doing a needless work, as to our Justification and safety: and accordingly are no more obliged by his favour to gratitude and obedience; with multitudes of the like pernicious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, which I will not bestow the time distinctly to handle, or form into several Arguments <hi>ab absurdo;</hi> I say, this Doctrine which so subverteth Christianity it self, and makes it but a name and shaddow, cannot be true. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s from eternity; To which I Reply, 1. No Scripture mentioneth the divers sorts of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which they feign (of which anon) 2. They have ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their parts in describing and distinguishing these two or three sorts of Justification or Pardon, which yet did lie so much upon them. 3. For ought I know, they do totally destroy the Merits of Christ: For 1. Mr. <hi>E.</hi> and the common sort of them acknowledge that it is not <hi>actum volentis,</hi> but <hi>rem volitam,</hi> which Christ procured or caused: so that Active Justification is hereby denyed to be any effect of Christs death: and how a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause can work immediately on the effect, without working on the Agent, and whether the effect of meritorious causes be not directly on the Agent, that he may produce the further effect, I have already desired Mr. <hi>E.</hi> to satisfie me Though this scruple may be well solved, yet I think, not by men of their principles. And what is the <hi>Res Volita?</hi> if it be only Justification <hi>in soro Conscientiae,</hi> it is unconceivable how Christs Merit can cause that, without causing the act of God. For the Declaration of our righteousness to our selves, they say is Gods act: and the sense of this, or the knowledge of it, Christs Merits do not immediately eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct: Merit is not terminated on our consciences. If they say, It is Right to Justification in conscience, that Christs Merits do
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118986:138"/> cause, as the <hi>Rem volitam;</hi> I answer, no Right nor real benefit can come to the Creature, (who is wholly Gods own, and at his dispose) but by the Will of God, granting it as the efficient cause: If therefore Merit be no consideration, causing Gods Will to grant that Right, there will be a difficulty in shewing how it immediately causeth the Right it self, especially to <hi>Ʋs.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will anon appear, that they leave nothing to Christs death to do in this neither; but that according to them, we had Right to all this, and much more, from eternity.</p>
               <p>2. The words of the most sober and learned man that I know of, that writes this way, are these, <hi>Here two things may be observed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J. Owen.</hi>
                  </note> 1. <hi>What we ascribe to the Merit of Christ:</hi> viz <hi>The accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Condition, which God required to make way, that the Obligation which he had freely put upon himself, might be in actual force. And so much (how rightly, I leave to himself to consider) doth Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>assign to our Works: Thes.</hi> 26. p. 140.</p>
               <p>And all know, that a Condition as such, is no cause, but an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent▪ or <hi>Causa sine qua non.</hi> And is not the death of Christ then fairly advanced, and his Merits well vindicated? My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant affirmation is, and still was, that mans works are not in the least degree truly and properly meritorious, and that they are such meer Conditions of salvation (not of our first Justification) as that they are no causes of any right we have (no not to a bit of bread, much less) to Heaven. Do not these men well defend the honor of Christs Merits then, if they give no more to them, then I do to mans works? <hi>viz.</hi> to be no meritorious causes, so much as of an hours temporal mercy? that is, To be properly no Merits at all: It seems to me therefore that they do by their Doctrine of eternal Justification or pardon not only destroy Justification by Faith, but also all the Merits of Christ▪ and leave nothing for them to do, for the causing of our pardon or Justification before God. Nay, whether this learned man can make Christs sufferings and obedience so much as a bare Condition, let them consider that read him, affirming that Conditions properly must be uncertain: and nothing is so to God: therefore there can be no Condition with God: therefore Christs death could be none.</p>

               <p>BUt I will say no more distinctly to this immanent eternal Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but speak to it and the other supposed Justification before Faith, both together; for dispatch. For all Arguments that conclude against Justification before Faith in general, will more evidently conclude against this supposed act from eternity, then that supposed act, at the undertaking or death of Christ.</p>
               <p>And here it will first be requisite, that we may not make the quarrel or difference seem greater then it is, that we discern how much of our controversie is about the meer name of Remission or Justification, and how much about the Thing or Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is agreed on both sides, that God doth from eternity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know every sin that men will commit in time; and that he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth to pardon (actually, and infallibly, and immutably) all the sins of his Elect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is agreed on both sides, that Christ gave himself a sacrifice and Ransom for the Elect; taking upon him those sufferings which he underwent, that we who had deserved everlasting suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering might escape.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I yield more then they desire or agree to, that Christs sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was a sufficient satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, and not for the Elect only; and that it was not only the sins of the Elect, which were the cause of Christs suffering, but of fallen mankind in general.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is agreed on both sides, that Christ dyed not for all alike, or with an equal intent of pardoning and saving them: But that he had a special intent infallibly to pardon and save all his Elect; and them alone: And that the Father had the same intent in giving his Son to death; and therefore gave him the Elect to be infallibly saved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is agreed on both sides, that Christ did perfectly pay the Ransom which he undertook, and left not any part unperformed: and that he overcame Death and Satan, and was Discharged by
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118986:139"/> Gods publick Declaration, and that in him God was well pleased. This much we agree in.</p>
               <p>The first thing now to be handled, wherein we differ, is, <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> Whether all, or any part of this be to be called the <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of any particular person, not yet believing or born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 1. I affirm, that <hi>It is not fit to say that we are Justified by all or any of this, before we are born, or believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. If the Scripture never call this our Justification, (or say we are Justified before we are born, or believe) then we may not fitly so call it. But the Scripture never calls it so, (nor so affirmeth): therefore we may not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Major, I take the Consequence as granted to be good, on this explication: That I do not say that in no case it is fit to take up any Name which the Scripture hath not used: but in this case it is not fit. For 1. We should not depart from the language of Scripture, in sacred things, without necessity: But here is no necessity: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Specially if it be a point of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation, and not naturally known. But this is such: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 3. And specially if it be a controverted point, where new made terms, or altering of terms in the application to the thing, may foment differences, and cloud the Truth: But this is such; therefore. 4. And also specially, if it be in a case of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where mistakes are more dangerous. But this is such; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. And especially if it be a Name or Word, which is very frequently used in Scripture in another sense, and never in this sense: For then it is worse to use that word to a sense diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of Scripture, then to devise words that are not in Scripture at all: For it tends to lead men to a Misunderstanding of all those Scriptures that otherwise use it. But that is undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the present case: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that I think I may safely conclude that it is not fit nor safe to depart from the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense in the use of the word Justification here.</p>
               <p>And for the Minor, that Scripture never so useth this word. To avoid the tediousness of reciting every Text where the word is used, and examining them as to this point, it may suffice 1. If you will turn by your Concordance to the Texts, and peruse them impartially, you may satisfie your selves. 2. If we only speak to those Texts that are pretended to speak in this sense: it is enough. We have often urged the Antinomians to cite one Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:118986:140"/> that saith, <hi>We are Justified before we were born, or do believe;</hi> and we could never yet see one produced that had any strong appearance, of speaking in that sense. Nor do I remember any more then two, that ever I heard produced, with any shew of Reason.</p>
               <p>The first is that <hi>Rom. 4. 5. To him that worketh not, but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him that Justifieth the ungodly, his faith i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> counted to him for Righteousness.</hi> The forementioned learned man saith, <hi>Perhaps also this may be the Justification of the ungodly, mentioned</hi> Rom. 4.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J. O.</hi>
                  </note>

               <p n="1">1. The Text by <hi>ungodly,</hi> plainly means (in my judgement)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Anton. Fayus <hi>on the Text,</hi> Syrus Interpres le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note>
                  <hi>unjust:</hi> God makes those just, by giving them part in Christ, who are unjust by their own sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The common answer also, is far liker to truth then their Exposition: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is <hi>in sensu diviso,</hi> he that was ungodly, (and that in the same moment of time wherein he was justified) and not he that was so in order of nature after Justification as well as before, yea and in time too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ungodliness is by most Divines supposed to be opposed to sanctification, and not to our first Faith: and they judge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (till Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>) that Faith goes before Justification and Sanctification. And therefore it might be said that the person Justified is ungodly, as being unsanctified; but not an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If they say, Can a Believer be unsanctified? I answer, There is no moment of time, wherein a Believer is unsanctified: but because in order of nature a man is first called, and then a Believer, and then justified and sanctified, therefore Justification going before Sanctification, and after Faith, the object must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly denominated, <hi>quoad momenta rationis, non temporis;</hi> and we must say, God justifieth an unholy man, (because he is not holy in order of nature till after Justification;) but not that he justifieth an unbeliever, because he is in order of nature a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever first. Though I speak not this as giving you any opinion of my own in this point, yet it being the common Doctrine of the Protestant Churches, should not by Protestants be slighted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. At least they that bring this Text to prove the Justification of the Elect before believing, must confess that there is no such
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118986:140"/> words in the text. And therefore they that will affirm that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> is as much as <hi>unbelieving,</hi> their bare word is no proof: and therefore we must expect some better▪ or take the point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay, what need we more words with them, when the Text twice over tells you what <hi>ungodly</hi> ones are Justified, even <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi> It must be, <hi>He that believeth on him that Justifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> and it is <hi>his Faith (that) is imputed to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And this man is not an unbeliever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second text cited to prove <hi>Justification</hi> to be a word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the eternal act, or to some before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith or exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that person, is <hi>Rom. 8. 33. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Justifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Answ.</hi> The whole scope of the Chapter shews that it is the sanctified Elect that are here spoken of, and not any other. <hi>It is they that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh, but after the Spirit, to whom there is no condemnation.</hi> v. 1. to 14. <hi>It is they that are led by the Spirit of God, and so are the Sons of God.</hi> v. 14. <hi>That have received the Spirit of Adoption.</hi> v. 15. <hi>Having the Spirit bearing them witness that they are the children of God.</hi> v. 16. <hi>That are heirs, and joynt heirs with Christ.</hi> v. 17. <hi>That have Hope and Love to God.</hi> v. 24. 28. <hi>and are Saints.</hi> v. 27. <hi>And God doth exactly tell us his order of gifts.</hi> v. 30. <hi>where calling goeth before Justification.</hi> In the very text it is plain; 1. It is such Elect ones as are <hi>chargeable</hi> and <hi>condemnable,</hi> if God did not justifie them. But so are not any unborn. 2. It is such as the world is apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and slander, and condemn, and this is spoken to encourage them against such sufferings from the world: But the world doth not so persecute the Elect while they are unconverted, and run with them to all excess of riot, and are foolish, disobedient, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers lusts and pleasures: but when they break from their captivity, and escape the pollutions of the world. 3. It is such as Christ is interceding for, as for strength and perseverance. 4. It is such as <hi>Paul</hi> was confident should persevere, and nothing separate them from the Love of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And, though I do believe that there is an Absolute Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Individual persons to Faith and Salvation, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118986:141"/> that the words <hi>Elect,</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> do often signifie that which is in time, if not far more often then that which is from eternity: When God by his Spirits effectual Grace doth choose one, and pass by another, this is (executive) Election, and these so actually chosen or taken out of the world to Christ, are Elect: and this is the most usual sense of the word in Scripture, as I think.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Text speaks of such as God himself doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: but God by his Law doth condemn all Unbelievers, the Elect as well as others; though not with a Peremptory, Remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Condemnation. For he that believeth not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: And God hath concluded all under sin. God chargeth with sin, conscience chargeth them, and others may charge them. I conclude therefore that this Tixt cannot be understood of Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If the name <hi>Justification</hi> be not fitted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Decree of God to pardon us, or the present immediate effects of Christs satisfaction, as to us, before we did exist: then it is not fit to be ordinarily applyed thereto: But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Consequent. Here we should examine the nature of the thing it self, and the sense of the word, but the former will be our work anon, when we come to speak of the Real or Doctrinal difference between us in this point; and the latter is oft enough done by others. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next verbal difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu. 2. The name of Pardon or Reconciliation is not fit to be given to Gods eternal Decree of Pardoning, or to any eternal act, or any act not procured by the Mediation of Jesus Christ.</hi> The proof is the same with the former. There is no word of▪ God (that ever I observed, or heard produced by any of them to that end) that doth so use the word Pardon or Reconciliation. He that saith there is any, let him prove it if he can. I admire that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do something in it, or give up that cause, being so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to it as they have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu. 3. Though the names of</hi> Reconciliation, <hi>and</hi> Taking or Purging away sin, (<hi>and perhaps Pardon) may be applyed to that which Christ hath done for us with God, by his Merits, before we believe or were born, yet should it be very sparingly, and never but with sufficient caution to discover, that we mean not an Absolute,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118986:141"/> Actual Reconciliation of any man, nor such a pardoning, purging, or taking away his sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason is▪ because 1. Scripture useth these words thus, but very seldom. You hear not any act at Christs death called by any of these names, once, for many times that you hear of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to Believers, and Reconciling them to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. You never read these words so used in Scripture, but with sufficient cautionary light (there, or neer at hand) to acquaint us, that it is not personal, actual, absolute pardon or Reconciliation that is meant: and usually this is done two waies; 1. In that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation or pardon mentioned from Christs death, before the sinner was born, is never mentioned (that I know of) with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation to the Elect, or any sort of men more then others, nor with exclusion of any sinner, but as a common Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Pardon: Now it is certain that all men attain not to an absolute, actual pardon and Reconciliation. 2. In that when the Scripture doth mention Reconciliation or purging away sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as done before we believe, it either prescribes us some Condition or Means by which it may be made Ours in particular, or else some other way makes it manifest that it is not yet ours, any more then the rest of lost mankinds. Let us peruse the particular places.</p>
               <p>The most remarked text, and most urged by them that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the word of Reconciliation: Now then we are Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christs stead, be ye Reconciled to God.</hi> To this I have spoken against <hi>L. Colvinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note here, 1. That the Text saith not, God was <hi>Reconciled</hi> to the world, but <hi>God was Reconciling the world:</hi> He did much, and as much as concerned the sufficiency of a Sacrifice, Ransom and Satisfaction towards an actual Reconciliation, which through their own wilful rejection, many do miss of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note that the Text only saith, <hi>God was Reconciling,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not Imputing</hi> their sin. Not that he did not at all impute sin to them: but he was then, not dealing with them according to the desert of their sin, but in mercy: So far was he in that work from imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin to them, or then charging it on them, that he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118986:142"/> a sufficient Remedy for the pardon of it, if they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it freely given.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Note that it is not any special sort of persons, that are here spoken of, but <hi>the world;</hi> whether simply considered, as the whole race of mankinde▪ or whether the Gentiles as well as the Jews: it is to <hi>avoid</hi> an exclusion of any, and not to <hi>exclude</hi> any: and therefore it is not meant of the Elect only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next words most plainly shew that they were not yet actually reconciled, when the Office of Embassadors is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to beseech men in Christs stead, and as if God did it by us, to be reconciled to God. If they were Reconciled already, what need Ministers beseech them to be Reconciled? I remember <hi>Den</hi> and other Antinomians say, that God was reconciled to them, but not they to him: but this vain objection I have answered in two former writings already.</p>
               <p>The 2. Text that is urged, is <hi>Joh. 1. 29. Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.</hi> Here note 1. The text saith not that, He hath taken away, but he <hi>taketh away,</hi> as <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> signifying his continued act in taking away sin: So that it saith nothing of taking it away before we believe. <hi>Beza</hi> thinks <hi>John</hi> pointed to Christ in reference to his Baptism, to shew them that it was by vertue of Christs blood, that the sins of the baptized were taken away. 2. The word here used, may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the taking away of sin it self in its power, as well as Guilt: And though we may not expound it as <hi>Grotius</hi> doth, of taking away sin it self only, yet we may well do as other Expositors do, extend it to both. <hi>Beza</hi> blames them that restrain it to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Punishment only, and himself expounds it of both, Punishment and Power of sin. Now it is certain that Christ took not away the Power of sin, or sin it self before we were born, or did believe. 3. Note that, if it were granted that it is meant of taking away sin, at the time of Christs death, yet it would prove but a common taking away, and therefore not an Absolute and Actual pardon: For if it be so understood, the world will never be proved to be meant of the Elect only.</p>
               <p>Another text that is stronger in appearance then this, for the phrase in question, is <hi>Heb. 1. 3. When he had by himself purged our sins, sate down on the right hand of the Majestie on high.</hi> To which I say, 1. The text saith not he pardoned or Justified us,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118986:142"/> but <hi>he made a purgation,</hi> as the words are expresly. 2. They whom we in this oppose, deny not but that it is the sin it self, or power of it, as well as the guilt▪ that is purged away through the blood of Christ: yet none will say that sin it self, or the strength of it is purged away, before we are born or believe, but only that Christ made a Purgation, which should in time, being applyed, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and actually purge us from sin▪ 3. The text having reference to the Jewish sacrifices, doth plainly speak of Christs blood as a price or sacrifice; and only intendeth that he did make a sufficient Purgation of our sins, <hi>quoad pretinm, vel s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>crificii per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem:</hi> as far as concerned him as sacrificer of himself. He did all that was his part on the Cross to do; though there remained more to do in the application and conveyance of Right to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, by his Word and Spirit: If the High Priest had offered a sacrifice for the sins of an obstinate impenitent sinner, he had not thereby made a legal effectual Purgation of his sin, supposing the sinner, at least, to declare his Dissent and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. Yet it is so much that Christ hath done before we believe, that we may see Reason why it may bear the name of <hi>Purgation or Reconciling;</hi> because it is a Pardon sufficiently purchased by him, and granted freely by God to all that Refuse it not, when it is offered them. If a Kings Son pay a Ransom for 100. Traytors, and his Father grant and seal them a pardon, is it not fit or tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable language to say, the King hath pardoned these men, or the Prince hath bought their pardon? Yet it is no actual pardon, till they consent, if we suppose it to be granted on Condition of their Consent or Acceptance. And so reasonable, so naturally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary is that Condition, that it is not used to be expressed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons or the like Grants, but implyed; But whether expressed or not, it is in the nature of the thing most commonly supposed: And if it did run in an Absolute form, yet is Acceptance still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed as an unquestionable Condition, and as to it, the Pardon is not intended to be Absolute. Yet if such a Pardon were brought to a Traytor at the Gallows, and he refuse it, and be hanged; men would say, that <hi>The K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng or State did Pardon such a man, but he wilfully refused it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know no other texts that have neer so strong appearance of favouring their cause, as these cited, especially the last, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall not need to mention any more; but come to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal difference.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:118986:143"/>
               <p>ANd here it is hard to say wherein we disagree, because they agree not among themselves, some saying one thing, and some another. Most of them say, that we are actually pardoned and justified in Christ at his undertaking to dye for us; and that it is but the knowledge, and comfortable feeling of this that is wanting to us: Mr. <hi>Crandons</hi> words are these in his <hi>Epist. Dedic. Justification as an Immanent act in God: As actually compleated in the Redemption which is by Christ, and in Christ; both these before we believe.</hi> So that it is Actual and Compleated Justification, which they suppose to be before Faith. Many of them use to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves, that Christ being the Publick person, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented all the Elect, and they dyed in him, and satisfied in him, and were justified in him.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Learned man, makes the ground of the Elects Absolution to be, <hi>they dying with him,</hi> as he speaks: and<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                  </note> saith that <hi>Christ is Reckoned to us,</hi> and <hi>Gods Reckoning Christ in our present sense, is the imputing of Christ to ungodly unbelieving sinners for whom he dyed, so far as to account him Theirs, to bestow Faith and Grace on them for his sake.</hi> And <hi>If then this be done for Christs sake, then is Christ made ours before we believe:</hi> And <hi>I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how any thing should be made out to me for Christ, and Christ himself not be given to me.</hi> And the Question he offers is this: <hi>Whether Absolution from the guilt of sin, and Obligation unto Death, though not as terminated in the Conscience for Compleat Justification, do not precede our Actual believing?</hi> So that this learned man seems to judge that the name of <hi>Compleat</hi> Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proper to that in Conscience, and not to be given to any before. He seems also to judge that Justification hath Degrees and Parts at many 100 or 1000 years distance one from another: Or else Absolution at least hath, which we have hitherto taken for the same thing with Justification. For as he calls this in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>Compleat Justification;</hi> So he saith <hi>Absolution in Heaven, and Justification, differ as</hi> Part <hi>and</hi> Whole. By this much it may be gathered where our difference lyeth in sense, as well as terms. We will except then Justification as <hi>Terminated in Conscience,</hi> and speak to that which is terminated, or (<hi>passivè sumpta</hi>) consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our meer Relation, of being <hi>Iust:</hi> Of all the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118986:143"/> forts of Justification that will fitly bear that name (I mean of Actual Justification of such persons,) the first in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is <hi>Constitutive Iustification,</hi> or <hi>Making us Iust:</hi> and therefore if I prove that this is not before Faith, it must needs follow that the rest are not. I confess the grounds of their mistake do call lowdest for a Confutation. 1. That <hi>We dyed with Christ,</hi> or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in him, or fulfilled the Law in him. 2. That Christ is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us in special manner more then to others, (the not-Elect) before we believe. Against both these I would oppose these two Conclusions.</p>
               <p>1. We did neither Really, nor in Gods Account, Dye with Christ when he dyed, nor in him satisfie Gods Justice, nor fulfil the Law. <hi>Con.</hi> 2. Though Christ were given for the Elect, more then others▪ yet is he no more given to them then others, before they are born, or before they have Faith. The first of these is of so great moment, and is the heart and root of so many Errors, yea of the whole body of Antinomianism, that I had rather write as great a volumn as this against it, then leave it with so brief a touch as here▪ must do, if I should particularly fall upon it. Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now suffice, to tell the Affirmers, that it is their part to prove it, which I think, they will never be able to do, while Scripture is taken for Gods Word.</p>

               <p>I Will come therefore to the point in question, and prove this Conclusion contrary to theirs.</p>
               <p>Conclu. <hi>No man now living was Iustified, Pardoned, or Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved actually from the guilt of sin, and Obligation to Death, at the time of Christs death, or undertaking▪ or from eternity, or at any time before he was born, or before he did believe; (or being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, had a Believing Parent.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Though I think it reasonable that the Case of Infants and Heathens that hear not the Word, should be <note n="*" place="margin">I mean not whether they are at all justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but of the manner.</note> laid by in this dispute, least the case be carried into the dark, and men argue <hi>à minùs notis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:118986:144"/>
               <p>I put the Conclusion in their own terms: To me and other men, all these (or 3 at least) are one and the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> To be actually justified, and pardoned, and Absolved from the guilt of death, and Absolved from the Obligation to Death or Punishment. Guilt is an Obligation to Punishment; at least, Guilt of death distinct from the meer <hi>Reatus Culpae.</hi> The dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Obligation to Punishment, is Pardon (that is the true Nature of pardon.) Pardon is taken by some to be the whole of Justification, and the same thing; though notionally differing: by others to be part of it, and Imputation of righteousness the other part: or Accepting us as Righteous, as others. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Absolved from the Guilt of Death, and from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Punishment, then we are certainly pardoned and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And this must be in Law-sense, as to Right and Title, and Constitutively, at least. For it is the Law that obligeth us to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and concludeth us under guilt: therefore if the Laws Obligation to Punishment be dissolved, then in Law we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and Constituted Righteous. This is it therefore that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and shall now confute; and in this sense I shall disprove the pretended pardon and Justification of the Elect, at the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, or death of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. From <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. He that Believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> He that is condemned, is not pardoned, absolved or justified: He that believeth not, though Elect, is condemned; therefore.</p>
               <p>I know nothing that can be said against the Major, but that he may be condemned in one kind▪ and yet absolved in another. But that is nothing to the Argument, as long as Condemnation and Absolution are here taken in the same kind. Absolution, as you heard, is taken for Dissolving guilt of Death, or Obligation to Punishment, or Absolving from these: And Condemnation here must needs be taken as opposite to that kind of Absolution: for to that in conscience it is not opposed, as I have already proved: And to that at Judgement, whether by Witness, Advocate, or Sentence, it cannot be here opposed: For many that are now condemned as unbelievers, shall Believe▪ and then be Absolved.</p>
               <p>The common answer is against the Minor, that the Text speaks only of such Unbelievers, as shall so live and dye and are not Elect: But when that is proved, they say something. In the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118986:144"/> mean time, if Christ say without limitation, that <hi>He that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not is condemned already;</hi> We shall take it for a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and not an Exposition, to say, the meaning is, Not all that believe not are condemned, but they that shall so live and dye: Else I know not what Scripture may not be thus perverted. So <hi>Origen,</hi> or any of that mind might have said, that the Text which saith, <hi>Their worm dyeth not, and their fire is not quenched;</hi> is not meant of all the damned, but of those that continue there Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. They that are dead in Trespasses and Sins, and by nature the children of wrath, even as others, were not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, absolved or pardoned, as aforesaid, in Christ, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or were born. But many of the Elect were (after Christs death) dead in trespasses and sins, and by nature the children of wrath, even as others▪ therefore.</p>
               <p>I think the Major needs no proof. The Minor is expressed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. 3. All the answer that is commonly given is, that They were Justified in Christ, and yet children of wrath in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: But what is the meaning of <hi>in Christ,</hi> and <hi>in themselves?</hi> One man hath but one person, and that cannot be at once justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned, in the same kind. Its like they mean as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> expresseth himself; that it is not we that are the subject of that Righteousness, but Christ. That is plain dealing: but then it is undenyable that it is not we that are justified by it, but Christ: For no Accident is ours, or can denominate us, whereof we are not the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. From <hi>Ephes. 2. 12. At that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Israel, <hi>and strangers from the Covenants of Promise, having no hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world.</hi> They that are thus without Christ, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Promise▪ Hope, God, are not in Law Absolved from the guilt of death, and obligation to punishment: But such are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Elect, if not all before they believe: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 4. From <hi>Tit. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For we our selves were sometimes foolish, disobedient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But after that the kindness and Love of God our Saviour, toward man appeared: not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saved as, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy-Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly, through Iesus Christ
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118986:145"/> our Saviour; that being justified by his Grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> If we are not justified nor made Heris before the washing of Regeneration, then we are not Justified or Absolved from the guilt of death, before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or were born: But the Antecedent is true (and plain in the Text:) therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 5. They that are under the Curse of the Law, (that is, obliged to death eternal by it) are not justified, or absolved from the guilt of death. But the Elect before Faith are, at least many of them, if not all, under the Curse of the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Major I suppose will be granted; for the Law to curse men to death, when the Obligation to that death is Dissolved, and they absolved from it, is to contradict it self or God.</p>
               <p>The Minor I prove thus. They that are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse. Many, at▪ least, of the Elect before Faith, are of the Works of the Law: therefore they are under the Curse.</p>
               <p>The Major is the Word of God, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the curse.</hi> The Minor is plain, unless no such Jew or Legalist be convertible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 6. If all are concluded by Gods Laws under sin, that the Promise by Faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that Believe, then the Elect are not Absolved from the guilt of sin or death, before they believe: But the Antecedent is Gods Word; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. From <hi>Rom. 3. 23. 9. 10. 19. We have before proved both Iews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin. For all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God. There is none righteous, no not one. That all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> They that are not righteous, but have sinned and come short of the Glory of God, and are under sin, and guilty before God; are not Absolved from the guilt of sin and death, nor Justified: But such are the Elect before they believe: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 8. From <hi>Rom. 5. 12, 13, 14. Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: For until the Law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed where there is no Law; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less death required from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moses, <hi>even over them that had not sinned after the similitade of</hi> Adams <hi>transgression,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>But not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:118986:145"/> as the offence, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the free Gift,</hi> &amp;c. Those, over whom death reigned, (according to the sense of this text) through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of sin, both original and actual, were not Justified or Absolved from the Guilt of death, before they were born, or were Believers: But such were those to whom the free Gift came for Justification by Faith in Christ: therefore. I take it for granted that those whom I dispute against, do take the efficacy of Christs death to be immediately after the fall, or that <hi>Adam</hi> was sentenced, and the Promise made, and not only since the time of his actual dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 9. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Those men are not yet absolved from guilt, and Justified or Pardoned, over whom sin reigneth unto death, on whom judgement is come to condemnation, that are so made sinners, as not yet to be made righteous, justified, or have received the free gift: But such are the Elect before they believe: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 10. From <hi>Rom. 7. 1. Know ye not, that the Law hath Dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</hi> They, over whom the Law hath Dominion, are not Absolved from its Obligation to Punishment: But such are the Elect before believing (all or some) <hi>vers.</hi> 4. therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 11. They that are the Servants of sin, free from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, doing that whose end and wages is death, in whom sin did work, to bring forth fruit unto death, that are not under Grace, but under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. are not Absolved from the Laws Obligation to punishment, nor pardoned. But such were the Elect (all or some) before believing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14, 15. 13. 16, 20, 21, 23. and 7. 5. therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 12. From <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> This plainly implyes, that till men are in Christ Jesus, there is still Condemnation to them. Those that are not yet freed from Condemnation, are not Justified, absolved, pardoned: But such are the Elect, till they are in Christ Jesus: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 13. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 6, 7, 8, 13. They that have that carnal mind which is death, and enmity against God, and cannot please God, and shall die, if they hold on, these are not yet Justified, Pardoned, or Absolved from the Laws Obligation
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118986:146"/> to death. But such are the Elect (all or some) before they believe: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 14. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. He that is not made free from the Law of sin, and death, is not absolved from the Laws obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punishment. But <hi>Paul</hi> an Elect man, before he believed, was once not freed from the Law of sin and of death: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 15. From <hi>Rom. 8. 9. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> He that is none of Christs, is not Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from the guilt of death. The Elect that have not the Spirit of Christ, are none of his: therefore. Though they are chosen by him, they have no Legal Right to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 16. From <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 24, 32, 33, 34, 36. They that are yet in their sins, and not made free by the Son, are not Absolved from the guilt of death: But such are all Unbelievers, though Elect: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 17. He that lies under the Threatning, that he shall not live; he that hath no life in him, (neither of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor Sanctification) such are not Justified or Absolved. But they that eat not the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood, have no life in them, and (except they do it) shall not see Life. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 53, 54, 57, 58, 59. Read the Text, and note that it is not upon the meer shedding of Christs blood, but on the eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood by Faith, that we receive eternal life, in the beginnings and right to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 18. From <hi>Psal. 5. 5. Thou hatest all workers of Iniquity.</hi> Those whom God hateth, he hath not yet Justified or Absolved from the guilt of death. But the Elect before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion God hateth: therefore. The Minor is proved: God hateth all workers of Iniquity, the Elect before Conversion are workers of iniquity: therefore.</p>
               <p>I know this is a hatred consistent with the Love of Election and Redemption: but not with the Love of actual Reconciliation, Remission, Justification or Absolution from the guilt of death For this Hatred is, when God stands related to them as any enemy, according to the terms of his Laws, which is, while the effects of Hatred, that is, Destruction remains their Due according to Law. And this cannot be when they are absolved from that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and pardoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 19, From 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 8. 10. 7. Let no man deceive you:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118986:146"/> he that doth Righteousness, is Righteous, even as he is Righteous. He that committeth sin, is of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In this the children of God are manifested, and the children of the Devil: whosoever doth not righteousness, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi> They that are not of God, nor Righteous, nor are the children of God, but are the children of the Devil, are not yet Justified, Pardoned, Reconciled and Absolved from the guilt of death. But such are the Elect before conversion: therefore. The Minor is too evident. They that do not Righteousness, nor Love their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the children of the Devil. The Elect before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion do not righteousness, nor love their brother (at least some of them): therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 20. From 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 14, 15. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: He that loveth not his brother, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>deth in Death,</hi> &amp;c. He that abideth in death, and is not passed from death to life, is not Justified, Pardoned, or Absolved from the guilt of death. But the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conversion abide in death, and are not passed from death to life: therefore. The text proves the Minor. He that loveth not the brethren abideth in death, and is not passed from death to Life. The Elect before conversion, love not the Brethren: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Death here is not only the power of sin, but the guilt of death: and life is not only holyness, but Relative life also, and Right to life eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 21. From 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 10, 11, 12. He that believeth not, hath made God a Lyar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> He that hath not the Son, nor that life which God hath given in him, is not yet Absolved from the guilt of death, nor Pardoned, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustified. The Elect that yet believe not, have not the Son, nor that life which God hath given in him: therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 22. Heb. 11. 6. Without Faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> If it be impossible for the Elect to please God without faith, then they are not actually reconciled to him, nor pardoned, nor absolved from the guilt of death without Faith. But the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is true, therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
               <p>The common Answers, (and all that I know of) that are made to this, are these two. 1. That the person is not in himself, but in Christ only Pleasing or Acceptable to God, without Faith:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:118986:147"/> and then in himself acceptable when he believeth. To which I Reply; If by <hi>in himself,</hi> they mean <hi>Objectivè,</hi> that Christ, and not he himself is the Object of Gods Acceptation, or that God is well pleased with them, <hi>habetur propositum,</hi> they grant what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: It is not the Unbeliever, but Christ that is righteous too: therefore let Christ be the subject denominated only, if he be the only Object of Acceptation: say not then that men are Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Pardoned, &amp;c. If by <hi>in himself,</hi> they mean <hi>causalitèr,</hi> by way of Merit, I hope they will not stand to it, that the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate do meritoriously please God in themselves, (no more then the unregenerate) but only in Christ. 3. Or if another way be found of pleasing God, yet it is here a general denyal of our pleasing God; and if you will limit it to any one kind, it must be to that pleasing which is proper to the Regenerate, which is to be Adopted, Reconciled, Absolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. To say that we please God in Christ before we believe, is but to contradict the text, which saith we please him not: and supposeth that we are in him before we believe, which is against the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The second Answer I remember in Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> and its the most common, <hi>viz.</hi> that They cannot please God with their Actions, or their Actions are not such as please God, but their persons do: therefore this text speaks not of their persons, but their actions. To which I Reply, 1. That this is a contradiction: for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to please God, and all his future sins be pardoned before hand, and especially in the Antinomian sense, so as for God to see no iniquity in them, and yet to be displeased with his Actions. As nothing but imputed sin can make God displeased, so the Act and the Actor are so neerly related, that if the act displease God, the Actor must needs, in some measure, or so far, displease him. If dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure be taken for dislike, or disapproving, then God doth so far dislike or disapprove of the persons, even of Believers, as he disapproveth their actions: that is, He disliketh them as evil actors, or as sinners, at the same time when he is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and loveth them as Redeemed, Reconciled, Pardoned sinners in Christ. But if displeasure be taken for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Castigatory punishing displeasure, then this cannot be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately terminated on the sin, but the sinner: It is not actions that are punished, but men for actions. God was displeased with <hi>David</hi> himself, and not with his actions only. If <hi>displeasure</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that It is against Gods will that such actions are, then I say,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:118986:147"/> as it is his Legislative will <hi>de Debito,</hi> that must be here understood, so it is as much against his will, that such a person do it, as that it be done: He doth not use to constitute the Dueness of actions, without determining of the persons from whom they shall be due; Actions are not the subjects of his Government, so properly as actors. He forbiddeth actions no otherwise, then by forbidding the persons to commit them. He saith not, There shall be no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, adultery, &amp;c. but, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, &amp;c. Moreover, when the sin lyeth in the Act of Reasoning, Willing, Nilling; the Elicite Acts of the Rational soul, it is somewhat nice distinguishing, to say, God is not pleased with the Actions, but he is fully pleased with the Actor: And they that assert such curious niceties, should do well to prove them plainly out of Scripture, if they can, and not expect that all men should be so credulous as themselves, nor too easily accept them on their bare obtruding, and naked affirmation. My plain opinion is, that though God be most eminently and principally pleased with us, in Christ, and for his Merits, and not at all for our own, yet that he will not be perfectly pleased with us in this life, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that life, when by Christ we shall be presented to him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, blameless, without wrinkle or spot. He that perfectly pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, is himself most perfect, as having attained his end, and therefore is glorified in heaven.</p>
               <p>2. But all this that I have spoken, is not very needful: for it is not only unproved that it is only the actions, and not the persons that the Text speaketh of, but the contrary is most evident in the Text. For <hi>v.</hi> 2. It was the Elders themselves, and not only their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that obtained a good Report by Faith. In <hi>v.</hi> 4. it was <hi>Abel</hi> himself that obtained witness that he was righteous; and not only his action in <hi>v.</hi> 5. it is said of <hi>Henoch</hi> himself, that he had this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, that he pleased God. So that it was <hi>Henoch</hi> himself, &amp; not only his action. And then the words of the text in hand are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately added as an Assumption, <hi>But without Faith it is impossible to please God:</hi> whereby it is past question that it speaketh of the same Pleasing as the foregoing words do, which is of the person.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, <hi>Atqui fieri non potest, ut absque fide quisquam Deo sit Gratus,</hi> applying it to the person.</p>
               <p>And the next words which are given as the reason of these, do further evince this. <hi>For he that cometh to God (and so will be Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118986:148"/> of him) must believe that he Is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> And it is the Person that he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth</p>
               <p>All the following Chapter running in the same strain, doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest, that it is the person that cannot possibly please God, without Faith, and not only his Actions, it being the Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Justification, or Salvation of Persons by Faith, that the whole Chapter treats of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 23. From 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, nor Abusers of themselves with mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners shall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God: And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus▪ and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Those men who lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Threatning of being shut out of heaven, even by the Law of Christ, and on whom that threatning shall be executed, if they be not washed, sanctified, and justified afterward, are not yet justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, pardoned or absolved from the guilt of death. But such are the Elect before conversion: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 24. From <hi>Gal. 5. 18. 23. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the Law. Against such there is no Law.</hi> They that are under the Law, and against whom the Law is, are not Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from the Laws Obligation to punishment, that is, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or justified. But such are all unconverted ones, even the Elect that have not the Spirit; therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 25. From <hi>Gal. 5. 2, 3, 4. Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testifie again to every man that is circumcised▪ that he is a debtor to do the whole Law. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are Iustified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> They that are Debtors to do the whole Law, and to whom Christ is become of none effect, and profiteth them nothing, as to the matter of righteousness, are not justified, pardoned, or absolved from the guilt of death: But such are some of the Elect, before effectual saving Faith: therefore.</p>
               <p>The Major seems to me to need no proof. The Minor is plain from the Text. <hi>Paul</hi> supposeth some of the <hi>Galatians</hi> either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118986:148"/> in this Condition, or too neer it, and in possibility of it: And yet he supposeth them Recoverable, as appeareth by his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and many particular passages in the Epistle. 1. Seeing it is not the sin against the holy Ghost, no man can give a reason why the Elect, before true Conversion, though after convictions and common profession, may not fall into it as well as others. The sin is not uncurable nor unpardonable: Nor hath God made any Promise that none of his Elect shall fall into it. 2. Nay the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Apostle plainly sheweth that all the Jews that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Justification by the Law, and not by Christ, (which was the case of the unconverted, at least of many), were in the same condition, even Debtors to do the whole Law, and Christ of none effect to them, and profited them nothing.</p>
               <p>The Text seems so plain, that it is not easie to discern what may be objected: But we may conjecture they will say: <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It was <hi>in foro Conscientiae</hi> only, or in their own feeling that Christ was of none effect to them, and not before God. <hi>Answ.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is plain in the Text. 1. It is a greater matter then a misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Conscience, or an ignorance of the felicity which they had Right to, that the Apostle speaks of: as the whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle shews. 2. He saith expresly, that they <hi>are debtors to do the whole Law;</hi> So that it is matter of Debt, and not meer matter of knowledge, conceit or sense, that he speaks of. 3. He saith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Christ profiteth them nothing, and is become of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to them: But surely if they had then Right to salvation, and were pardoned, justified, absolved from all guilt of death, then Christ did profit them very much, though they wanted the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all this. <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Apostles words must be understood with some limitation: for if Christ profit them nothing, then they cannot have Repentance and Faith from him, and so cannot be recovered. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is plainly to be understood, as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand: that as to Justification, Remission of sin, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging from the Debt of the Law, he is yet of none effect to them, and profiteth them nothing. 2. Though he have satisfied Gods Justice for them, and intend in time their infallible conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by giving them Faith and Repentance, yet these are in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and have made no change on them, and therefore Christ is yet of none effect to them, and profiteth them nothing, either as to Sanctification, or Justification and Absolution.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:118986:149"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Text speaks only to them <hi>that are Iustified by the Law,</hi> and that is no man. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But do you think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks to no man? 2. The text saith, <hi>Every man that is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,</hi> and that was not no man. 3. If any had really been justified by the Law, they had not been so miserable as <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes these. 4. It is plain therefore that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of those that expected to be justified by the Law, and so thought and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but were not so indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Paul</hi> speaks only on supposition that they live and dye so, and then they are not Elect. <hi>Answ.</hi> That is to contradict the text, and not to expound it. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the present tense, <hi>To every man that is circumcised, Christ is become of none effect.</hi> And he speaks to them as miserable, and yet curable, and therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth the cure of some, and the preservation of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 26. From 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 27. Whosoever shall eate this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> He that is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, is not absolved from that guilt. Some Elect men are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord: Too easily proved, in that they before Conversion may eate and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily; therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 27. From <hi>Heb. 8. 11, 12. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> If God do put his Law into mens minds, and write them in their hearts, and give them to know him, at the same time when he pardoneth their sin, and putteth them out of his Remembrance, then Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels or men unborn are not pardoned: But the Antecedent is plain in the text: therefore.</p>
               <p>They cannot say, it is only pardon in conscience that is here spoken of, for it is Gods <hi>Remembring their iniquity no more; and being merciful to them, being their God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 28. From <hi>Heb. 9. 15. And for this cause he is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Testament, that by means of death for the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the Promise of eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> If Christ were the Mediator of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this cause, that his death for Redemption of transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, might be a means, that they that are called might receive
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:118986:149"/> the promise of the Inheritance, then was it no effect of Christs death, to give that Promise to the uncalled, (and if not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of eternal Inheritance, then not of Absolution, for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that they go together): But the Antecedent is true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so is the Consequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 29. From <hi>Jam. 5. 20. Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the errour of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</hi> So <hi>Mark 4. 12. Lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</hi> If upon Conversion mens sins be forgiven them, hidden, and their souls saved from death, then were they not forgiven, and Absolved from the guilt of death before. But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the Consequent. It cannot here be said that it is in conscience only that all this is done: for that wer enot to save a soul from death, but to save a soul from the sorrowful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of death (which yet the wicked are seldom troubled with): if that the man were saved and absolved from the guilt of death before. Nor were this to forgive them so properly, as to acquaint them that they were long before forgiven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 30. From <hi>Act. 26. 18. To open their eyes, and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Remission of sin, and Inheritance among them that are sanctified, by Faith that is in me.</hi> If it be Gods Order to give men illumination, and Faith that they may receive Remission of sins, then their sins were not before Remitted: But this is Gods Order: therefore, They receive not what they had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 31. From <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he called, them also he Justified,</hi> &amp;c. Justification is placed according to Gods Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Calling and Glorifying: therefore it is not before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or were born. The more are these two last cited Texts to be regarded, because they do the most clearly, and as of purpose express the order of the causes of salvation, or of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to us the saving fruits of Christs death▪ of any that I know of in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 32. From <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3. with <hi>Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8, 9. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no guile.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that all this is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:118986:150"/> when Faith is Imputed for Righteousness. If mens transgression be then in order forgiven, their sins covered, and not imputed to them, when their Spirits are without guile, and when they believe, and not before; then Infidels, or men that are no men, are not forgiven, Justified or Absolved. But the Antecedent is true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 33. From <hi>Act. 8. 21, 22, 23. Thou hast neither part nor Lot in this matter, for thy heart is not Right in the sight of God: Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of Iniquity:</hi> whether by <hi>this matter</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be meant <hi>in Christ, and the Grace of Christ,</hi> or else <hi>in the Word of Promise which we preach;</hi> the matter comes all to one. He that hath yet no part or lot in Christ or the Promise of the Gospel, and is not forgiven, but is in the Gall of bitterness, and obligation of Iniquity, is not Absolved from the guilt of death, or obligation to Punishment. But such may an Elect person be, before conversion: therefore. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved from the text thus, 1. There is no sin here charged on <hi>Simon,</hi> but what an Elect man unconverted may commit. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> supposeth this, when he sets him on praying for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 3. His reason, <hi>for thy heart is not Right with God,</hi> makes this the case, in some degree at least, of all whose hearts are not right with God: and that is the Elect as well as other, before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 34. Act. 13. 38, 39. Through this man is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all things from which ye could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moses. If that Justification which is opposed to the (supposed) Justification by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> come with or after believing, then no Infidels are absolved from the Laws Obligation to death. But the Antecedent is plain in the text: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 35. From 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9. If we confess our sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> And vers. 7. <hi>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.</hi> If those that will not confess sin, nor walk in the light be not forgiven, nor cleansed from all sin, then no
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118986:150"/> Infidels or Impenitent ones, though Elect, are forgiven, or so cleansed. But the Antecedent is plain in the text. therefore.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, 1. That he saith not, that no other are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is most plainly implyed: or else the Apostle could not make Confession a Condition, no nor so much as a sign, to distinguish the pardoned from the unpardoned. 2. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that this is spoken of true Believers, and yet they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. <hi>Answ</hi> 1. Prove that it is spoken of them. 1. They walk in the light. 2. And confess sin. 2. If it were, yet would it hold <hi>à fortiore:</hi> If true Believers, whose former sins are pardoned, shall not yet have their future sins pardoned, but upon Confession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then much less shall they that yet have no sin pardoned, receive pardon while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 36. From <hi>Prov. 24. 24. He that saith to the wicked, Thou art righteous, him shall the People curse, nations shall abhor him</hi> If God have forbidden it men as a hainous sin, to say, the wicked is righteous, then he will not do it himself. But the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is true: therefore.</p>
               <p>Though the Consequent hold not in all cases, yet in this it will, where the reason of the prohibition is because the thing spoken is false: for God cannot lie. <hi>Obj.</hi> But this is spoken only of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousness, and not of that which consisteth in a Right to Impunity. <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny it, God forbiddeth also Justifying the wicked, as an abomination to him. He that saith to the wicked, either, <hi>Thou art not wicked,</hi> or <hi>Thou art not condemnable, guilty of death, or obliged to punishment;</hi> doth justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth them sententially by the Gospel that are not Justifiable by the Law: But he Justifieth them no further then they are truly Justifiable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are never righteous in our selves, but in Christ. <hi>Answ.</hi> God makes us our selves Righteous, by giving us right to Impunity and the Kingdom, for the sacrifice and Merits of Christ. <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are not righteous inherently with such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our own Works, as will suffice to Justifie us against the Accusations of the Law. <hi>Answ.</hi> Nor doth God ever

If many of the Elect before Conversion are cursed of God, and his curse be in their house, then are they not Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all guilt of death, and obligation to punishment. But the Antecedent is plain in the text; therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 38. From <hi>Psal. 10. 3. Zach. 11. 8. Psal. 5. 6. Pro.</hi> 11. 20. and 17. 15. and 28. 9. and 15. 8, 9. and 16. 5. If the Elect before Conversion are abhorred of God, and are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him, and their sacrifices, and prayers an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, then are they not Justified, pardoned, actually recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or absolved from guilt of death. But the Antecedent is plain in the text: therefore.</p>
               <p>At least me thinks they whom we oppose, should see the ground of their Assertion subverted by all this: For if the perfection of Christs satisfaction were a sufficient ground to conclude that God must needs immediately pardon and absolve us, or did so, or that he were unjust if he should lay any penalty on us, when Christ hath born our punishment, then the same reason would prove it unjust in God, to Curse us, Abhor us, Abominate us, and actually inflict castigatory punishments on us, when Christ hath born our punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 39. For brevity, shall be from all those texts that affirm Remission of sin, and Justification to be given to men, if they will Repent and Believe, or to be by Faith, or to follow faith: <hi>Act. 10. 43. To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive Remission of sins.</hi> Act. 2. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Iesus Christ for the Remission of sins.</hi> Luk. 24. 47. <hi>And that Repentance and Remission of sin should be preached in his name among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Act. 5. 30, 31. <hi>Whom ye slew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to</hi> Israel, <hi>and forgiveness of sins.</hi> So those that speak of the forgiveness of the particular sins of the Godly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Commission, and where they are taught to pray for it.

Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith: therefore we conclude that a man is justified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law. Seeing it is one God that shall justifie the Circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the Law through Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2. Therefore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ. By whom also we have access by Faith into this Grace wherein we stand. Gal. 2. 16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Iesus Christ, even we have believed in Iesus Christ, that we might be Iustified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law: for by the Works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi> Vers. 20. <hi>The Life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal. 3. 7, 8. Know ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they which are of Faith, the same are the children of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Gospel unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; In thee shall all Nations be blessed. So then they which be of Faith, are blessed with faithful</hi> Abraham. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that no man is Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident: for the just shall live by Faith: and the Law is not of Faith. 22. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the Promise by Faith of Iesus Christ, might be given to them that believe. 24. Wherefore the Law was our School-master to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith. 26. For ye are all the children of God by Faith in Christ Iesus.</hi> So <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 13, 14. to the end. Many more to the like purpose might be added, in which it appears that Gods time
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:118986:152"/> and order of giving us pardon and justification, is upon our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and not while we are Infidels: and that this is a Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Law sense, and not meerly in conscience▪ as was before proved: It was not only by Christ and the Absolute Promise made to the Elect, but it was by the Law of Faith that boasting was excluded. I will not stand to answer the vain objections here brought in by some, knowing that the light of the express text to the impartial may suffice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 40 Shall be from all those texts, which say Faith is imputed to us for righteousness: which upon these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations do cleerly evince the point. 1. That it is not only a judicial Sentence, much less a sense or Reception in conscience, which both imply that the person is before constituted or made righteous in Law; But it is the very giving and imputing of righteousness it self that is here mentioned. 2. When the interest of Faith is such that it is said to be imputed for righteousness, it is undenyable that it is not while we are Infidels that we are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>I go not about now to determine how far, and in what sense it is that Faith is imputed: but in what sense soever it is, it shews that Faith there must be, or else how can it be imputed for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at all. As for them that say▪ that by Faith, is not meant Faith, but Christ, I hope I shall not believe them, as long as I believe that God would be understood: and that the Word is a Lamp and a Light, and not a darkness. And for some of the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines themselves, that say that it is <hi>Christ believed in,</hi> that is meant by Faith, though I doubt not but Faith Essentially includeth Christ its object, and therefore accordingly connotes it, and therefore whenever it is said that Faith is imputed for righteousness, or that we are justified by Faith: it is connoted that we are in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kind of causality justified by Christ, then by Faith (Faith indeed being no proper cause); Yet I believe not that by <hi>Faith,</hi> is not meant Faith it self, but only Christ: and the contrary to him that will read the text impartially is as evident, as any sense can be in words: But yet if it be <hi>Christ believed in,</hi> that is meant by Faith, then Faith there must be: It is not Christ despised, or not believed in that justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:118986:152"/> righteousness. 5. To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteousness. 6. Even as</hi> David <hi>describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth righteousness without Works. 9. Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>for righteousness 10 How was it then reckoned,</hi> &amp;c. 11. <hi>And he received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the Faith▪ which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, that righteousness might be imputed to them also. 13. For the Promise that he should be heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>or to his seed, through the Law, but through the righteousness of Faith. 16. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promise might be sure to all the seed. 18.

               <p>HAving produced these Arguments from the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture▪ I shall next add some more from the nature of the thing; by which the point in hand shall be evinced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. To Pardon, Absolve and Justifie, are acts of Jesus Christ, as King, and as Judge: By being a sacrifice and Ransom to satisfie Justice, he did not act as King or Judge: therefore by being a sacrifice and Ransom to satisfie Justice, he did not actually
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118986:153"/> Pardon, Absolve, or Justifie, (but only Merit Pardon, Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Justification, to be given by him as King and Judge.) Two things are in the Major to be proved: The first is that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Justification are Acts of Jesus Christ: And the proof shall answer them, that say, It is enough that it be an Act of God the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather for the sake of Jesus Christ. To which I say: It would clear much of these matters to mens understandings, if they would consider this great Truth, that, As it was not man that sinned, that did by himself (naturally or legally) satisfie Justice, so it was not thought meet that man himself should receive the immediate fruit of that satisfaction; but as it was a Mediator that suffered for us, so was the world delivered over to the Mediator as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of them, as being his own, being bought with a price: and so the pardon that was immediately granted by the offended Majesty was into Christs hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and not the sinners own that is, A Right of granting out pardon to them as a King-Redeemer, on terms most agreeable to his ends and interest: (with resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to do it equally to all, nor with equal success.) So that God as the offended Legislator of the first Law, upon satisfaction made, was reconciled, as far as the Intention of the Satisfier and satisfied did require; that is, so far as to Remit all into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers hands, and give him Power, Right and Commission to grant Pardon by a new Law, which should not be as the old which was fitted to man in perfection, but a Law of Grace, fitted to man in sin and misery, giving him a Saviour and salvation on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of meer Acceptance. (Purposing to cause his chosen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to accept him.) So that though the Father as Rector ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Law, being satisfied, did give to the Redeemer a Right of pardoning us and delivered all things into his hand, yet the actual pardoning of us must be an act of the Redeemer himself (and the Father in and by him, as God-Redeemer) by a Promise, Covenant or Law of Grace, made as King, after the Moral being of his satisfaction. Now that Christ hath made no Act to pardon man, but the Law of Grace, promising Remission and Justification if we Repent and believe, I shall shew further in due place. The second thing to be proved in the Major, is, that as Remission and Justification are acts (or an act) of Christ, so it is of Christ as King and Judge▪ I will first prove the former that Christ himself hath Received a Right of pardoning. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.

For as the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. And hath given him Authority to execute Judgement also, because he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in the Graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the Resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the Resurrection of Damnation.</hi> Rom. 14. 9. <hi>For to this end Christ both Dyed, Rose and Revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. Phil▪</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. But what should I stand on this for, among Christians that confess Christ as Mediator, to be the King: All those texts that mention his Kingdom, and Kingly Power, prove it. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. All that call him Christ the Anointed, prove it. And yet what stiff perverse arguings have I heard from Learned prejudiced men, (for fear of yielding to any kinde of general Redemption, if they yielded that Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor▪ hath a Kingly Power over all) maintaining that this Power he hath as God, and not as Mediator; that is, Christ is not Christ, the King. God would have his Crucifiers affix to his Cross the Title of King. By these Texts mentioned, it is evident that Christ
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118986:154"/> hath Authority and Right as Mediator to grant Pardon of sin, and that he hath made a Conditional General Act of Pardon hereupon. So that both the parts of the Major are proved toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the nature of the thing proves it to all men that know what Pardon and Justification is. It is the Pardon of the breach of publike Laws that we are speaking of, and not of private tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes or damages.</p>
               <p>To whomsoever it belongs to make Laws, to him it belongs to Remit offences against those Laws: But to the Supream Power, or Legislator it belongs to make Laws: therefore.</p>
               <p>To whomsoever it belongs to Judge men for breach of Laws, to him it belongeth sententially to Justifie him that is Justifiable. But to Christ as Judge it belongeth to Judge men: therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I will recite one text more that containeth all that I have said. <hi>Act. 5. 30, 31. The God of our Fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to</hi> Israel, <hi>and forgiveness of sins, and we are his witnesses of these things, and so is the holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</hi> Here we have first his sacrifice, then his Resurrection, then his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation and Kingdom, he is become a Prince and a Saviour, or a King-Saviour, or Lord-Redeemer: Where note, that all his work of saving us was not on the Cross: that prepared for the rest which was to follow. He was exalted to be a Saviour and Prince. And then we have the end or effect of his being exalted to be a Prince and Saviour, which is to give Repentance and Forgiveness of sin. As a Prince he doth this, because it is necessarily a work of Soveraign Power, or of a Ruler or King: As a Saviour he doth it, because the thing wrought in this work is our salvation, to the perfection of which it also tendeth.</p>
               <p>Having proved the Major Proposition, I need not say much to the Minor, it being granted, for ought I can understand, by all that I have to do with; that Christ doth not pardon and justifie by satisfying or meriting, directly: For as to satisfying it is past que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: And Merit, is a remote cause, moving (to speak after the manner of men, as we must do) the Principal Agent: and so upon Christs Merits, God as Soveraign did deliver up all to his Son, as Saviour and Soveraign, and gave him Power to forgive sins.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:118986:154"/>
               <p>Observe also, that if all this were denyed (that Pardon and Justification are Acts of Christ as King) and if we granted that they are Acts of God the Father, and not of the Mediator, yet we shall confute eternal Justification as an Immanent act, thus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, Absolution, Pardon, are acts of God as Rector: God was not Rector from eternity; therefore, Justification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don are not acts that were in God from Eternity. The Major is past question. The Minor is proved thus: A Ruler and Subjects to be ruled, are Relatives, and exist together; one cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or without the other. But God had not subjects from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Ruled, certainly not man, (unless all creatures co-exist with God, not only in Eternity, but from eternity) therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. Where there is no actual guilt, there can be no actual Remission or Justification. But from eternity, or the time of Christ, there was no actual guilt on any that did not then exist (or were not then conceived) therefore from eternity, or from the time of Christs death, there could be no actual Justification or pardon of such.</p>
               <p>The Major is proved by the definition of Remission or Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ever contains guilt as the thing destroyed thereby. All Remission or Justification is a Remission of some guilt, or a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification against or from some guilt, real (in Constitutive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification) or charged (in sentential Justification) therefore actual Remission must be of actual guilt. Remission is a dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Obligation to punishment. Guilt is the Obligation to punishment: therefore.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, that there could be no actual guilt on us from Eternity is past doubt. Nor yet at Christs death, when we were not in being. We were no subjects or Entities, and therefore had no Accidents or Modes.</p>
               <p>To this two things are answered; 1. That from eternity our guilt had an <hi>Esse cognitum.</hi> I Reply, 1. That is not to <hi>Be guilt:</hi> 2. That <hi>esse,</hi> if any where, was in God, for there was no other subject of it, But it was not guilt, but knowledge that was in God. 3. There was no <hi>esse ab aeterno,</hi> but God himself. But God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was not guilt 4. To be <hi>Cognitum,</hi> makes a new <hi>esse</hi> in man▪ (<hi>viz. Rationis</hi>) where the Object causeth. But it makes no new <hi>esse</hi> in God, with whom Objects have no Causation: therefore guilt had no true <hi>esse ut Cognitus</hi> from eternity properly so called;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118986:155"/> but a formality at most. 5. Gods knowing, was a foreknowing, (Scripture so calls it): not a knowing that a man then was, or was guilty, but that he would be, or that it was <hi>futurum.</hi> Therefore man was not guilty: <hi>futurum</hi> is <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> as to <hi>existens,</hi> and so is <hi>prae cognitum.</hi> I conclude therefore, that man was not guilty from eternity, and therefore not capable of pardon.</p>
               <p>2. It is objected, that at Christs death we were guilty, because we were all guilty in <hi>Adam.</hi> I Reply; When we exist, we are said first to be in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so to be guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> as we are the progeny of him. But properly, before we exist we were not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He that was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> was not guilty in <hi>Adam:</hi> They that now live on earth, were not in <hi>Adam</hi> at Christs death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not guilty in <hi>Adam.</hi> The Minor is plain; for, He that <hi>was not,</hi> was not <hi>in Adam:</hi> But he that now lives on earth, <hi>was not</hi> at Christs death: therefore he was not in <hi>Adam.</hi> To be in <hi>Adam,</hi> supposeth <hi>to be. Obj.</hi> In Gods account we were in him. <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so: Gods account is according to truth: therefore he accounts not those in <hi>Adam</hi> that are not. <hi>Obj.</hi> All mankinde sinned in <hi>Adam:</hi> therefore they were in <hi>Adam. Answ.</hi> Mankind is taken either for the humane nature, or for each Individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And <hi>sinning in Adam,</hi> signifieth either that they personally sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> at the time when he sinned, or else that he then committed a sin which shall begin to be theirs, when they shall exist. And so I say, that the humane nature did sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> and my person as soon as existent is guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and so far may be said to have sinned in him; but my person did not as a person really or reputatively sin in him before it did exist, or was a person. <hi>Obj.</hi> If our guilt or sin were not then Reputatively in Being, how could it be laid on Christ, or Christ bear it <hi>Answ.</hi> It was not sin it self▪ or guilt in it self, the same with our Individual guilt that Christ bore. But he contracted, as it were, a guilt by his own voluntary sponsion, which he did, not because we then were guilty, but because he foreknew we would be guilty, and by that guilt liable to punishment: and therefore to prevent our punishment (not our guilt) he offered that sacrifice of himself on the Cross, on consideration whereof, our guilt, when it did exist, should be done away: Not that it did then exist, or was then done away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it must be known that all that then did exist, were actually guilty.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:118986:155"/>3. And that Christs sacrifice was for mankind in general, the humane nature being then guilty; though God did know and determine the particular personal application, and intended the pardoning of each individual Elect person by it. But there is more required to the full explication of this, then I may now stand to perform: and I remember I have spoke to it against <hi>Lud. Colvinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. He that is capable of pardon, is capable of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. They that are now living here, were not from eternity, or from Christs death capable of punishment (actual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal) therefore they were not capable of pardon (actual and personal.) The Major is plain, in that guilt is an obligation to punishment: and he that is obliged to it, is capable of it. If it be due, men are capable of it. The Minor is evident, in that a <hi>non en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> is not capable of punishment. Punishment hath a subject: a <hi>non ens</hi> is no subject for it: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Remission of sin gives Right to Impunity. From Eternity, or at Christs death, we had no Right given us (who are now here living) to Impunity. Therefore from Eternity or Christs death, we had no Remission.</p>
               <p>The Major is past doubt. The Minor I prove thus. <hi>Non-enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, non est modus vel Accidens.</hi> Non-Entities have neither Mode nor Accident. Right to Impunity is a <hi>modus vel Accidens,</hi> and we were then <hi>non-entia:</hi> therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> We were <hi>Entia</hi> in Law, or in Gods account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so, for their Judgement is according to truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The children unborn may have such a Reputative Being in Law, and in the estimation of Donors, or Contractors, that they may by Deeds and Conveyances be made the subjects of right or Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so, it is no actual Right till they are actually sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. And they cannot be made actual subjects by a mans conceits or suppositions. Nature is supposed in Morality. There is only an Instrument made in such Donations, or Contracts, which shall give Right when the subject is capable; Or a sign by which the will of the Donor is sufficiently signified, that on such a supposition, at such a time, such shall have Right. As in natural motions, a man that shoots an Arrow, may have irrevocably deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:118986:156"/> it out of his own hand, when yet there is a certain space of time before it shall come to the Butt or Mark: So in these civil actions or motions, a Donor that gives a thing <hi>in diem,</hi> or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor that doth Promise it <hi>in diem,</hi> may (if the Donation be Absolute) irrevocably <hi>quantum in se,</hi> part with his right, or emit the Right, or perform such an act which shall give Right <hi>quando venit dies:</hi> but <hi>donec venit dies,</hi> till the set time, the Right is not received by the Legatory, Donatory, &amp;c. it comes not to him; and so is not his. And if it be thus in an Absolute Donation, which is <hi>in diem,</hi> much more in a Conditional, where the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is suspended on a Condition, Contingent in it self, and uncertain to the party that is to perform it. And especially where the subject to receive it is not yet in being. Mens Covenants in such cases, do but contain that signification of their will which shall then prove <hi>fundamentum Juris,</hi> or give Right to the child when it is born, and be intrusted in the mean time in the hands of others for them, if they shall exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj:</hi> But we have before we are in being a <hi>Jus ad Rem,</hi> though not a <hi>Jus in re,</hi> because God promised it to Christ for us, or to us in him; and it is just that God make good his Promises, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have Right to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall the rather speak to this Objection, because the late mentioned <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                  </note> learned man builds so great a Fabrick on it. 1. The things to which we are said to have Right, is, <hi>The good things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.</hi> Absolution from guilt and so pardon of sin, is one of the good things purchased. If this be so, all is granted that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, as to the point in hand. For he that hath but right to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or Absolution (though it were absolutely granted <hi>in diem</hi>) is not yet pardoned or absolved: There must be the <hi>Jus in re,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can truly and properly be said to be pardoned and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. While he hath but a right to be absolved for the future, it is certain that he is not Absolved at the present. Even as he is not sanctified or glorified, that hath not the thing it self, and so a <hi>Ius in re,</hi> but only a <hi>Ius ad rem,</hi> a right to be Sanctified and Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore for all this (pretended) Right <hi>ad rem,</hi> none are Absolved or Pardoned from the time of Christs death, much less from Eternity.</p>
               <p>2. But I maintain that we had no actual right <hi>ad rem,</hi> to future
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118986:156"/> Remission and Absolution from the time of Christs death, either <hi>ipso facto</hi> upon his dying or <hi>ipso Iure,</hi> upon the Promise of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son; yea or (which is more) <hi>ipso Iure</hi> upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by the Father and Son to mankind: But then we must first determine what <hi>Ius,</hi> Right is. It reacheth not our case to say that <hi>Ius est, quod justum est.</hi> It may be Just <hi>in natura rei,</hi> that such a man do such a thing, when yet no man may be said to have right to the action or its effect. At least it is <hi>Ius</hi> as <hi>existent,</hi> in some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to whom it is communicated, and in whom it doth as it were inhere, that we are to speak of. And we take not <hi>justum</hi> in so large a sense, as to comprehend <hi>non-injustum,</hi> as it is just for a man to pardon him that hath wronged him (according to the Law of man;) because it is not unjust, there is nothing against it: But we take it in a stricter sense.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to be the Object of that Act which is right and just, and another thing to be the subject of Right. It is one thing to <hi>Be</hi> Right and Just; and another thing to <hi>Have</hi> Right. To be Right, as every thing is that is Just, is a Relation of a lower nature then that which we treat of; being scarce more then <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> a Relation. When you say, <hi>Ius est, quod Iustum est;</hi> You deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a <hi>Thing</hi> just: but when we say, <hi>A man hath Right to this or that,</hi> we speak of the <hi>Person,</hi> as the subject (of Adhesion or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion) of that Right. It is only a Person, and not an Inanimate, or a bruit, or a meer Action or Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is the subject of the Right that we are to speak of. <hi>Ius est effectum Tituli, vel Relatio à Titulo resultans: Titulus est fundamentum Iuris:</hi> He that hath a good Title hath Right, But <hi>omne quod Iustum est,</hi> is not <hi>Relatio resultans à Titulo.</hi> The meer Object of a Just act, or the act it self which is just, is not said to <hi>Have Right to</hi> it self or another thing; as we say, man hath right to things, <hi>si jus est, quod justum est;</hi> then to set true Landmarks is <hi>Ius:</hi> But who is it, or what, that is the subject <hi>hujus Iuris?</hi> The Land hath no <hi>Right</hi> (civil Right) to the act: The act hath not Right to it self The Agent is the subject of that quality of Justice which causeth him to do Right: but is not said to have <hi>Right</hi> to his own Act. It is therefore some second person that <hi>hath Right</hi> to that just act of the Agent: In which words it is plain that the justness or right of the Act is one thing, (a respect by which that act is denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted just) and the Right which the second person hath to that act
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:118986:157"/> and its effect, is another thing (A Right commonly called Civil or Legal, adherent to the person, and founded in his Title.) For an Act or <hi>Thing</hi> to be <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Iust;</hi> and for a <hi>person</hi> to <hi>Have Right</hi> by Title, are in my sense no more the same thing, then for a person himself <hi>to be righteous,</hi> and to have right to a thing. So that in the sense in question, it is not true that <hi>Omne quod Justum est, est Ius.</hi> I take <hi>Ius,</hi> Right in the person, in our case, to be that which answers <hi>Debitum</hi> in the thing: For me to have Right to the Thing, and for the Thing to be due to me, is all one. I hope I may in this case have your free leave to mention the Judgement of <hi>Grotius</hi> (and to prize it with the highest) He distinguishing between these two senses of <hi>Ius (de Iure Belli, li.</hi> 1. §. 3, 4, 5.) saith, <hi>Ius hic nihil aliud quam quod Iustum est significat; idque ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante magis sensu quam agente; ut Ius sit quod injustum non est—Ab hac Iuris significatione diversa est altera, sed ab hac ipsa veniens, quae ad Personam refertur: quo sensu, Ius est, Qualitas Moralis personae, competens ad aliquid juste habendum vel agendum.

               <p>Some Reasons that perswade me, that we are so far from being pardoned and absolved at Christs death, that we had not so much as Right to be pardoned and absolved for the future absolutely <hi>in diem,</hi> are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We were not existent, and so not subjects capable of actual Right: As our selves were only <hi>in causa▪ potentia, &amp; esse cognitio, &amp; volito,</hi> so only must our Right be. God might, as it were, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himself to give us Right when we were, and were capable of it; and so it might be said to be just that he should give it. But we did not receive it till we were, and therefore it was not ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God had before given us Absolutely right <hi>ad rem,</hi> then he would not have after made a Conditional Grant of the same thing to us. But he did after make a Conditional grant of the same thing to us: therefore.</p>
               <p>The Major is plain, because it would be a retracting of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Absolute Grant: For as a flat denyal would have been a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal retraction, so to reduce an Absolute Gift to a Conditional, is a partial retraction: This then would seem <hi>non-justum,</hi> yea <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justum,</hi> or contrary to the former engagement. I would prove this more fully, but that it is not denyed.</p>
               <p>The thing that by the foresaid Learned man is denyed, is the Conditional Grant: He affirmeth that it is Absolute <hi>sub termino,</hi> and saith it is false that (the Redeemed while Infidels) are but upon Condition under Christs Merit▪ even so far under, as that in respect of Good or Evil their Condition is alike with those under Demerit, in point of Right.</p>
               <p>But whether Christ, <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> hold not that as true which he saith is false, and make not Faith and Repentance (or one at least,) Conditions of Justification or Salvation, I appeal to the frequent express words of the text, and to the whole world of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God made over to us at Christs death a <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> a Right to future pardon Absolutely, then it was, either by some Promise, or signal Grant, or by meer Decree and Purpose. But by neither of these; therefore not at all. There can no other way be imagined rationally that I conceive of, unless they say that <hi>ipso facto,</hi> by accepting Christs sacrifice, he gave us <hi>Ius ad rem,</hi> of which we shall speak anon; and now only deny it. That Decree
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:118986:158"/> gives not Right, is granted by most, and all that I know, (except this Learned man) that are worth the disputing with in such a point. The Immanent acts of God do <hi>Nihil ponere in objecto.</hi> That there is no signal Grant, either Vocal, or written, that gave us such a Right, must be taken for granted, till the affirmers can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some. If there be any in Scripture, it must be either the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to Christ, or the Absolute Promise of the first Grace to the Elect, or the Law of Faith or Grace, giving Life to all, if they will believe. The last is Conditional, and after the Moral being of Christs death, and therefore cannot be it: The second is also in order after the Moral being of Christs death, and therefore if it did give us Right <hi>ipso jure,</hi> it follows not that we had it on Christs death <hi>ipso facto.</hi> But indeed we have neither. For it is but a Declaration of Gods Decree towards some in general: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are neither existent, nor determinate, and therefore can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Right by it. If a man say, <hi>There are some poor men in this City, whom I will give such a Pension or Alms to before I dye.</hi> Neither describing, nor naming any, nor determining the number in his words; it is just that this man keep his word: but no man hath received Right to the Pension hereby. Much less if he do but profess his purpose to leave a Legacy to some that shall live 100 years hence, and do not now exist.</p>
               <p>But the first is the main ground of our Right alledged, of which (though I purposely avoid the contending with the foresaid learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, yet because I know not any that hath said so much as he, and therefore it will be to the advantage of truth) let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his proofs, which in his words lie thus, after this stating of the case, <hi>The sum then of what we have to prove is, that the Merit of the Death of the Lord Iesus, hath according to the Constitution of the Father, so procured of him the good things aimed at, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, that it is just, right, and equal, that they for whom they are so procured should certainly and infallibly enjoy them at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed season: and therefore unto them they have an Actual Right, even before Believing; Faith it self being of the number of those things so procured. All which I prove as followeth. 1. The very terms before mentioned infer no less. If it be</hi> Justum <hi>before their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that those for whom Christ dyed should enjoy the fruits of his death, then have they even before believing</hi> Jus, <hi>or a Right thereunto: for</hi> Jus est, quod Justum est▪</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:118986:158"/>
               <p>Reply. I deny the Consequence. Its reason is invalid. It may be <hi>Justum</hi> that God do it; and yet you and I, or others, be no subjects of the <hi>Ius,</hi> as receiving no Right thereby. If Right were received, it was only Christ that received it, to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made, and not we. He might receive a Right to Pardon us, and we receive no Right to Pardon. I desire also some clear proof of the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is right and equal that they should enjoy those fruits, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest. For 1. It was the engagement of the Father, to the Son, upon his undertaking to die for them, that they should so do.</hi> Isa. 53. 10, 11, 12. 2. <hi>In that undertaking he accomplished all that was of him required,</hi> Joh. 17. 4.</p>
               <p>Reply. Though it be the Consequence that I deny, yet I see not the Antecedent well proved: For to the first I say, 1. The <hi>undertaking of Christ to dye for them,</hi> means either some action of the pure God-head, before the Incarnation, or some Action at or after the Incarnation. If the first, either it was from eternity, or from <hi>Adams</hi> fall or at the time when that Prophesie <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. was given out. If the first, then it was 1. before that Prophesie, and therefore that Prophesie did not give Christ his Right upon his undertaking, at least not first. 2. It was nothing but Gods Decree, or some Eternal Immanent act, which is confessed by others to give no Right.</p>
               <p>If it were at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, 1. The Prophesie <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. was not then in being neither. 2. Christ was not then Incarnate, and God could not make temporal Covenants with himself. 1. It it but spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken improperly, after the manner of men, that God makes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, the Father with the second person in Trinity. 2. This which is so called a Covenant, must on the ground of them whom we oppose, be acknowledged to be from Eternity▪ as being an Immanent Act in God, which cannot <hi>oriri de novo.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing but Gods Decree or such Immanent acts that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Covenant between the Father and the Son, then in being; and this is confest not to give new Right, (and to us it gives none at all.) 3. The same holdeth, if they take it to begin at the time of that Prophesie, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. Christ being then meerly God, and the God-head being uncapable of formal Covenanting, and of receiving any Right thereby. 2. And the words in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. Seem rather a Prophesie, and a renewing of the Promise of a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:118986:159"/> Saviour to the world, then any Promise to Christ giving him a new Right. And as they concern mankind, they can give no actual Right to pardon, to particular persons; though they may give mankind in general a Right to a successful Saviour. The reason is before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But I suppose it will be said, that this Promise was not made to Christ as meerly God, but as foreknown to be Incarnate, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. To which I say: 1. The foreknowledge of the Incarnation makes not Christ to be man, and God esteems not himself man till he is so: therefore it makes not the second Person the subject of this new Right by this Promise or Covenant, till he be Incarnate indeed. 2. If upon all this it should hold good that Christ himself did not before the Incarnation, by any formal or proper Covenant or Promise receive himself any new Right, it would be much more evident, that no man before the Incarnation received any such Right, by his Reception, and by that same Covenant. Though for my part I think that a new Right did accrue to the pure God-head; but rather on mans fall with Gods Promise to Redeem him by the Son, then from the meer eternal Decree, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Covenant between the Father and the Son. But this requires a stricter enquiry.</p>
               <p>2. To the second proof I say, 1. We use to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the undertaking and accomplishment. Divines use to say, that upon mans fall, Christ undertook satisfaction, but it was in the fulness of time that he accomplished it. How therefore he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished it in the Undertaking, I do not well see. 2. But that he did perfectly accomplish what he undertook, I easily grant, as the ground of my hope: but that proves not a Right thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to the humane nature before it did exist.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I desire that none of this may be so understood, as if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that which we commonly call the Covenant between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, or the Right redounding to Christ thereby: Nay I think this Covenant or Law with the Mediator, to deserve a peculiar place in the body of Divinity, as of great moment, as I have elsewhere said: But the main thing I insist on is, that when Christ is a capable subject in his humanity of such Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet we are not thereby made the subject of it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That which is merited and procured for any one, thereunto he for whom it is procured, certainly hath a Right. That which is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118986:159"/> for me, is mine in actual Right, though not perhaps in actual Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. The thing that is obtained, is granted by him of whom it is obtained, and that</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>If you could make the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers all believe this strange Doctrine, you would make a great change in</hi> England.</note> unto <hi>them for whom it is obtained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. All this is as easily and confidently denyed as affirmed. A thing is procured <hi>For</hi> a man, either only <hi>finaliter,</hi> so as that mans good is the end of the procurement; or subjectively, so as it is procured into that mans hands or possession, as the subject of the Right or thing. In the latter sense, I deny that ever Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured pardon for us now living; so as that we should be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, or right to it, when he dyed: In the former sense, I yield that Christ did procure it finally for our good, and require some proof, that this makes us the subjects of that right. If a man contract with you, to give your horse so much Provender every day, I do not think that your horse hath any actual Right by it to his Provender: And if a King agree with you to be General of an Army for the reducing of a Country of Rebels, and give you power to grant a general pardon to all that will come in, and secretly agree with you to use such means with certain men named, that they shall infallibly come in and be pardoned; I will not believe without proof, that any one of these men hath a Right to pardon, upon this Contract between you and the King, <note n="*" place="margin">No, though you were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of success.</note> no nor upon the general act of pardon, which is much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In some sense or other, that is</hi> a mans, <hi>which is procured</hi> for <hi>him: In saying it is procured for him, we say no less. If this then be not in respect of Possession, it must be in respect of Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. 1. I confess this is as probable a way to make good your assertion, as you could devise. <hi>In some sense or other,</hi> is so large a word, that you may say what you will with that Caution. In some sense or other man is God; and that is yours, which indeed is none of yours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in the sense as custom hath taught men to use these words, I say, that If a thing be meerly <hi>For</hi> you <hi>finaliter,</hi> it is never the more yours <hi>subjectivè.</hi> You may have neither Dominion of, nor right to that good which may be for you. It might easily have been foreseen that somebody in the world would require better proof of this then bare affirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now all the fruits of Christs death are obtained and procured by his Merit,</hi> for <hi>them, for whom he dyed. He obtains for them eternal

               <p>Reply. 1. All fruits of his death, are not procured for every man for whom he dyed He procured not the same measure of Grace, Illumination, Sanctification, for me, as for some others: Nor the same freedom from temptations, sickness, malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor did he peocure Faith infallibly to be given to all for whom he dyed, as he did for his Elect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Reply. All unproved, and by me unbelieved. If you pay a summe to the Turk for a 1000 slaves thereby buying them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely into your own power; I do not believe that they have any more Right to freedom then they had before: though you have Right to free them, if you please. They are now your own: you may do with them as you will. Or if you resolve to free them, that gives them no Right. If a Prince pay a ransom for some Traytors to the King his Father, thereby purchasing to himself a Dominion (or Propriety) over them, so that they are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely his; though both Father and Son agree that all or some of these shall be so dealt with, as that their deliverance may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet I think it gives them no more Right to it then they had
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:118986:160"/> before. <hi>Negatio juris est injuria.</hi> I do not think that any Elect person could say, God did him wrong, if he did not pardon him before he was born, or while he was an Infidel.</p>

So it is said to be by the righteousness of God in the same respect, <hi>viz.</hi> as precious, and in respecting the object; because God hath Promised Christ and Glory to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers▪ and he is true of his Promise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others say, It is by the righteousness of God in that same promise, as that promise being the object, causeth our Faith: we knowing God to be true of his promise, do believe him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our new Annotations, and many others, mention a third, making <hi>the Righteousness of God</hi> to be put for the bounty of God, as oft in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Many take as not respecting the efficient cause, but the Object: God hath given us a precious Faith in his righteousness: or a Belief in Christs righteousness for salvation. <hi>Diodates</hi> words only I will repeate, <hi>viz. Whose foundation and object is Christs Righteousness; which comprehends all that he hath done and suffered for his: Others expound the word Righteousness for Mercy, and Goodness, or for Loyalty in keeping Promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Condition of persons under Merit and Demerit, in respect
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118986:161"/> of Good and Evil, is</hi> alike. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>But they must then be</hi> alike <hi>under Merit and Demerit.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>The proportion of things requires it. Now men under Demerit, are under an Obligation to Punishment: and it is a Righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them.</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 6. <hi>It being the Judgement of God, that they who do such things are worthy of Death.</hi> Rom. 1. 32. <hi>They then who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Merit, have also a Right unto that whereof it is the Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be <hi>under Merit,</hi> is a stretching word: but if there must be any force in the Comparison to be <hi>under Merit,</hi> must signifie to be Really, or Reputatively the Meritors of that good; or that we be the subjects of that Merit, as we are of the Merit of evil here compared to it. But how easie had it been to fore-see that we would deny, either <hi>non entia,</hi> or Infidels to be so under Merit; yea or any man living▪ though a Believer! And who can find here a word of proof of any of this? For my part I would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe it for a world, nor practice according to such princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I durst not go to the holy God with such a sacrifice, and say, <hi>Lord, the proportion of things requires it, that my Condition, while I was a wicked unbeliever, should be alike to Good, as is the Condition of Reprobates to Evil, as to Merit: I deserved salvation while I was an Infidel, as well as they deserve Damnation.</hi> Then God should have done as much injury in damning us, as he had shewed mercy in saving them. Then it seems you would not say to God, <hi>Thou mightest have justly cut me off in my unbelief, and cast me into hell:</hi> but contrarily, <hi>Thou couldst not justly have done it.</hi> And whether under such perfect Merit you think God doth not wrong you, if he inflict on you the least Castigatory penalty I know not! And may you not as fairly say, <hi>Lord, I have merited as well, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a sinner, under any of thine anger, any penal suffering, to dye, to lye in the dust till the Resurrection, (in my body</hi>) &amp;c. <hi>as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates deserve to be damned.</hi> The Lord save me, and all his Church from such principles. I cannot swallow and digest them, any easier then I can cease to be a Christian. I cannot chose but say clean contrary, <hi>Lord, I deserve thy wrath, and am by nature a child of wrath, and thou mightest justly have c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Men united to Christ by Faith, have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118986:161"/> claim to Christs Merits, then Infidels, though Elect: And yet I thank God I do not use to hear▪ Ministers in prayer (nor any Christians) talk to God in this language, and say, We have by Merit as good right to heaven, as the Reprobate to hell. Nay more, I doubt not to prove, that Christ never communicates his Merit in its formal nature, to any man; but only the effects of it: He gives us his Merit, as a man gives a prisoner 1000. li. which indeed he never shewed him in it self, or gave him, but only gave it the King for his ransom. It was not I that Merited but Christ, and I am no further under it, then to partake of the fruits of it, and that is by Degrees, in what time and measure he seeth meet to give them out to me: which is not all at once, nor all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, till another world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not of any force to say, that they are not under that Merit, but only upon Condition. For this is 1. False. 2. With God this is all one, as if there were no Condition, at the season and term appointed, for the making out the fruit of that Merit, as hath been declared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confess it is of small force, till they know what you will mean by <hi>under Merit;</hi> 1. If you will mean, that we are esteemed the Meritors, I confess it is false. For this is never true, or made out either Conditionally or Absolutely: no more then that you shall be Christ. Yet this seems plainly your meaning; but the proof we want.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you mean it of the effects of Christs Merits, they are of several sorts, and he that shall say, they are all given to us Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, I would say as well as you, it is false.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if it be the special fruit that we have in question, <hi>viz.</hi> Absolution from guilt, or actual right to it, I say that is given on Condition, or else <hi>If</hi> is not a Conditional term If thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus▪ and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And to say this is false, weighs as much with me▪ as your former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings to prove it false, which may not now axamine.</p>

The question is rather what it is with us▪ then with God when we enquire whether we be the subjects of that Merit and Right. 3. It is not true nor proved, that it is all one with God. God seeth things as they are, and therefore seeth not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118986:162"/> divers things as one: nor a Conditional Grant as an Absolute. 4. It is true that the Elect shall be as certainly Justified by the Conditional Grant, as if it had been Absolute: but this is so far from making them all one, that it more sets forth the Omniscience and Wisdom of God, that can bring man to his appointed ends, by means most fit to his nature, and as infallibly attain his ends by Contingent means, as by naturally necessary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Reply. Here is the heart of the whole Controversie, and (if I may have leave to speak as confidently as your self,) the Root of many dangerous errors, I think very plainly subverting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. I confess with comfort, that Christ was our Surety, and merited on our behalf, and in our stead in some sense, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he satisfied in our stead: But that <hi>we dyed with him</hi> when he dyed, I deny: I suppose you would by this intimate that he did not only Merit in our stead, but Reputatively so in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as that <hi>ipso facto</hi> his Merit was theirs, for whose sake it was performed, and they reputed to have merited in, by, and with him. This opinion destroyeth the substance of all Religion, as I hope to manifest upon fitter occasion. Though Christ did Merit for us, and suffer in our stead, yet it was not as our Delegate, nor did we do it in him in a Civil and Law sense, any more truly then in a natural. Nor is the sinner reputed to have done all that his voluntary Sponsor doth for him, nor is the benefit of it <hi>ipso facto</hi> his, but on what terms the Sponsor and the Creditor or Rector shall please to convey it.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>A Compact or Covenant being made of giving life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Condition of Obedience, to certain persons, that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being compleatly fulfilled, as it was in the death of Christ, claim being made of the Promise according to the tenor of the Compact, and the persons presented for the enjoyment of it, surely those persons have an actual Right unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. If the Covenant had been made with us, and we had performed the Conditions, or another for us, (so be it the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise had been made to us, upon such performance of another,)
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:118986:162"/> then all this had been true that you say. But a Promise to Christ that he shall have all things delivered into his hands, and have Authority to forgive sin, together with an Agreement whom he shall eventually call and pardon, this gives no man Right. That which is promised to another for our good, is not promised <hi>To</hi> us, though <hi>For</hi> us; nor giveth us any Right. For what you say of <hi>presenting the persons for the enjoyment of it,</hi> I understand not. 1. Did Christ present us to enjoy it before we had a being? 2. Or all the years of our Infidelity? why then did we not enjoy it? Or what was that which you call <hi>presenting us?</hi> 3. But if it were only when we received Faith that he so presented us for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then it seems we are Absolved but in the same moment as we believe. And then our <hi>dying with Christ</hi> when he dyed, did not Absolve us, nor give us Right. If the person must be so presented for enjoyment first, stay but a moment longer (and that not of time but of nature) and let him believe first, and we are neerer to agreement. Yet do I know of no presentment before Faith▪ that gives us Right, but much to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all this is so, see</hi> Isa. 49. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Psal. 2. 2, 4, 5. Isa. 53. 10, 11, 12. Joh. 17. 3. <hi>and</hi> 2. 21. Heb. 2.</p>
               <p>Reply. Whether any word in any of these texts give the least countenance to your assertion, I am content the Reader judge when he hath perused them. They prove that Christs death shall be successful; but for any word that we have a Right to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits before we believe, I mean, to the benefits following Faith, such as are Absolution and Pardon, he must have better or worse eyes then I▪ that can find it. Much less, that we are actually Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from guilt of death, and Obligation to Punishment. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. So much for that Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If we are pardoned or Absolved from guilt from Eternity, because it was Decreed, or at the time of Christs death, because it was then Merited, then all other Relations De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed or Merited should be from Eternity, or from the time of Christs Merits: But the Consequent is so false, that I need not say any more to manifest it: therefore▪</p>
               <p>God Decreed from Eternity that <hi>David</hi> should be King, and <hi>Aron</hi> Priest, and both Types of Christ: Yet were they not such from Eternity: Nor yet from the time of Christs undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:118986:163"/> to Merit it. If a man that was Decreed to have two or three wives successively, were husband to them all at once; <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether the Law will reach him for his life? Yet so it must be, if all his Relations are from eternity, because Decreed from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or from Christs dying, because then Merited. Was <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen from the time of Christs death? Was Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Mr. <hi>E.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> or any now living, a Pastor of a Church when Christ dyed? I hope none will say that God Decreed not these, or that Christ Merited them not.</p>
               <p>The Consequence is plain from the parity of Reason. If it be <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because Decreed or Merited that one is eternal or from Christs death, then other Relations that are Decreed and Merited must be so too.</p>
               <p>I put both together, because I deal with men that somewhat differ. Some do not so openly or plainly own the Eternity of Absolution as others do. The forementioned learned man saith; <hi>For the foundation of this Right, seeing that before the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death of Christ, it is not, from thence it must needs be:</hi> But whether this <hi>Consideration</hi> of Christs death be not from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and so our Merit and Right from eternity, in his judgement, I am uncertain: By some passages I should hope better: but these words make me doubtful; <hi>That the Decree of God gives to no man a Right, to the thing concerning which the Decree is, is so far from being a sufficient proof of the Major, that it is in it self very questionable, if not unquestionably false. That the Dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee gives not being and existence to the things concerning which it is, is an old Rule. That no Right should from it arise unto that thing by vertue thereof, is not so clear. Right is but</hi> Jus; Jus est, quod Justum est: <hi>If it be Just or Right that any one should have such a thing, he is said to have a Right thereunto. Now supposing the Decree of God, that a man shall by such means have such a thing, is it not just, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and condecent unto righteousness that he should have it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. 1. It seems then we had our <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> from eternity: And then Christ did not Purchase or Merit it: for he is not the cause as Mediator of eternal effects (<hi>à parte ante.</hi>) And if we had Right from Eternity to Justification and Salvation, and that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>sub Termino,</hi> as you speak, to be ours, then when the term comes, we shall have it, as having Right to it before. And what doth Christs death cause by interposing? If you say, that it is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118986:163"/> not Decreed to us, or by Decree given us Absolutely, but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Christs Merits; I <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Take heed of making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Decrees, so as that any thing be a condition of Decreeing. 2. If our <hi>Jus ad Rem</hi> be but conditional, then actually it is none. 3. If Christs death be no condition of the Decree, it can be no condition of the conjunct effect, which is eternal too, if we have a Right from eternity. 4. Or if you judge that we have a Right to Life from Eternity, without any procurement of Christs Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that it is the <hi>Jus in re</hi> only that his Merits are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of; yet remember these things. 1. That you suppose a condition must <hi>tendere ad incertum,</hi> and therefore that with God there can be no proper Conditions: How then can Christs death or Merits be a condition? how can God make a grant of such Right to us, on this condition of Obedience, as you before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest? 2. We hope Christs death was not a meer condition, but a meritorious cause: And how it can be so on your grounds, is past my reach to know. 3. And what need it, or can it cause? The Right to Life we are conceited to have before (by many at least:) the Right in life needs no more but <hi>ut veniat dies</hi> to cause it, if we had it Absolutely <hi>sub termin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> And was this it that Christ dyed for, to procure us a Right to that which we had Right to before? Upon Christs dying it is still but <hi>Jus ad Rem,</hi> till the term come: and then our first Right would turn to a <hi>Jus in re,</hi> when we have the thing it self. If you say that God who Decreed the end, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the means, and though he gave us the Right to Life by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, yet he Decreed that Christs death should interpose as the means to the <hi>Jus in re;</hi> I <hi>Answ.</hi> What means is it? To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is but to comein such an order; but what doth it to the effect? Condition it can be none, if there be no condition with God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ause it can be none, of that which wants no cause but time to its production. Nor do I see, according to you, how it can cause meritoriously, if it cause not with God from whom it Meriteth. You did therefore more cautelously then satisfactorily take up with a word that will bear many interpretations, saying, <hi>It affecteth▪ Gods</hi> Justitiam Regiminis, <hi>and there you place its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing efficacy;</hi> which words I like well, if they were cleared, and well reconciled with the rest.</p>
               <p>But you grant it as an old Rule, <hi>That the Decree gives not being and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> demand then,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:118986:164"/> Did God Decree to give us Right to Life, or not? If not, then we have it not as Decreed. If he did, then the Decree caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the being of it: and then it had no being, for it had no other cause from Eternity.</p>
               <p>I speak all this more to the Defence and Confirmation of my Argument, then your confutation: For in doing that I should take another course, and deny the Definition of <hi>Jus,</hi> in the case in hand; and prove both, that if God should not perform his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it would not be injustice in him, or injury, (which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Jus,</hi> as in our case) but only mutability, (as <hi>Durandus</hi> imagined also, in case he should not perform his word, which is much more;) and that neither the Purposes of God or man, do convey any Right to another, of the benefit purposed: no nor a bare discovery of that purpose neither, nor that which some call a Pollicitation, as distinct from a Promise; but only such a Promise, Grant, or Law, whose nature and use is to transfer or convey Right.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If man hath a Right to all that God hath Decreed to him, then he hath Right to punishment, even to Hell from Eternity, before ever he sinned in himself or in <hi>Adam:</hi> yea before he was: and this punishment is his due: but that is not true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know most of those that are against me, will maintain that God Decreed from Eternity, that men should commit all the sins that ever are committed, <hi>ipso permittente, &amp; voluntatem ad actum, praemotione immediata efficari praedeterminante:</hi> and so sin was due to all sinners from Eternity, when they were no men: or they had then Right to it: but that is not true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No Right is conveyed to another, but by some Transient act, (for it doth make a change on the object, <hi>ponendo novam relationem:</hi>) But Gods eternal purpose is not such an act; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I may be bound to God to perform my purposes (yet not alway) but if hereby I give Right to men to all that I purposed them, all the world is ignorant as well as I.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 6. If we are Pardoned, Justified or Absolved from Guilt, either from Eternity, because it was then Decreed, or from Christs death, because it was then Merited; then would all real effects of Decree, and of Christs death, (as well as the Relative) be from Eternity, or from Christs death: But the Consequent is false: therefore so is the Antecedent. If we are therefore absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because our Absolution is Decreed or Merited, then on the same Reason we are Sanctified, raised from the dead, glorified, because these are Decreed and Merited, there being the same cause and reason of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. If neither from Eternity, nor the time of Christs undertaking, nor any time before we were born, or believed, we were made Heirs of the Promise and Kingdom, then were we not Pardoned, Justified, or Absolved from the guilt of death. But that the Antecedent is true, I prove by these Scriptures following. <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God of things not seen, as yet moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith.</hi> Tit. 3. 7. <hi>That being Iustified by his Grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal Life.</hi> Gal. 3. 26, 29. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by Faith in Christ Iesus. And if ye be Christs, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, and heirs according to the Promise.</hi> Gal 1. 7. <hi>And if a Son, then an heir of God through Christ.</hi> v. 30. <hi>The son of the bond-woman shall not be heir,</hi> &amp;c. 28. <hi>Now we, brethren, as</hi> Isaac <hi>was, are the children of Promise.</hi> Rom. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>That he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised, that Righteousness might be imputed unto them also. And the Father of Circumcision to them who are not of the Circumcision only, but also walk in the steps of that Faith of our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is very true; and the ordinary Doctrine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, yea of Scripture. But then observe, that this affirmeth, that we paid it not in our own persons. And this must be true, of <hi>a person</hi> in a civil sense, or Law sense, as well as a natural: That Debt which a man paies by his servant or other Delegate, he paies himself. It was done by his person in Moral, Civil, or Law▪ sense; though not by his natural person. It being therefore the Action of Laws (or according to Laws) that we have to speak of, it must be a Legal person that we must speak of. If therefore Christ had so Merited, or satisfied in your person, and you in and by his, that Reputatively the Law, or Lawgiver, did judge it the <hi>Idem,</hi> and not only the <hi>Aequivalens,</hi> and did esteem the person the same, and judge you to have merited or satisfied in Christ, then no Justice could deny you present Justification or Absolution without further pardon: though the natural person of Christ and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s was not the same.</p>
               <p>But indeed it could not be, that Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> the same that was due in Law: For that was <hi>supplicium ipsius Deliquentis,</hi> and not of another: Nor could it be that you should merit or satisfie Legally in Christ, he doing it in your person. For though in payment of debts to a Creditor (which is not our case) the Law admitteth payment by a Delegate, and taketh the person as the same, looking only at the Debt (for what a mans Instrument doth, himself doth) yet in case of Obedience and Punishment, the Law determineth of the person, as well as the thing due, and alloweth not a Delegation, or doing or suffering by an Instrument, or in the natural person of another: and therefore <hi>dum alius sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, simul aliud solvitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though God as Rector, <hi>supra Legem,</hi> as above Law, doth in our case, allow and Accept of a Sponsor, and kind of substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of punishment, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ should suffer in <hi>our stead;</hi> yet not as in <hi>our person,</hi> so as we do Morally or Reputatively sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie or merit in or by him: but in the person of a Mediator; that his Sacrifice, Satisfaction, Merit, may be a valuable Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which God may pardon our sins, in his time, and on terms agreeable to his honor and ends of Government. I take this to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:118986:166"/> be the truth, about the nature of our Redemption by Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Extreams of the Socinians (who deny satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Christ) and the Antinomians, (who say, that we satisfied, or obeyed and merited, or both, in and by Christ;) Two Errors of so great moment, subverting the very foundation, and whole frame of Christian Religion, that I confess my soul abhorreth them, though in all tollerable differences I can go far in bearing with dissenters. And I wonder that some Divines do look on this so lightly, as if it were but a verbal or inconsiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet, though it be true that God was bound in Justice presently to Absolve and Justifie us without further pardon, when we had paid all the debt (either of Obedience or Penalty) in and by Christ; it followeth not, that we are not pardoned: For God did pardon us by translating the Punishment from us to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: To put another into our person, was Gods pardoning act: He might have inflicted it on our selves, and he laid it on Christ: therefore we are not Justified without pardon of sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is the answer I confess, of some men, whose parts and worth one would think should promise much better. They yield to, and maintain what I said before; that we did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and merit in and by Christ, and that God could not in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice deny us present Absolution or Justification without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardon, (except in the after Manifestation of this to our consciences.) But then they think this act of Deputation, or change of the person is a sufficient pardon. To which I say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I did not mention the exclusion of all pardon, in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; but only of <hi>all pardon merited by Christs death,</hi> or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or by any act of obedience, which he is supposed to do in our persons, and we in him. And according to this desperate Doctrine which I gain-say, there can be no pardon merited for us by Christ. For this change of the person, which is mentioned, was both naturally and morally (according to their supposition) antecedent to Christs satisfaction and merits: we are supposed first to be made or reputed one person with Christ, and then to have satisfied and merited in him: That is, to be first pardoned, and then to have satisfied and merited.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I deny that this deputation or change of the person, (if it were true) were any actual pardon of sin. The definition is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:118986:166"/> not the same: therefore the thing is not the same. Indeed it might presuppose a pardon (according to their grounds) but is not a pardon it self: For it is not a dissolving the obligation to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, nor a Giving us Right to Impunity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth not this make Gods punishing of us in Christ to be unjust? For if we were pardoned before, how can it be just that we should pay all the debt after? or suffer what was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? For if it be we in Moral or Law-sense that satisfie, then it is the same person that was pardoned that satisfieth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if we did satisfie in Christ, then nothing was pardoned to us; if the person were Legally the same.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But suppose these two last answers may be put by, (by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is a pardon to our natural person, though not our legal; or some such frivolous reply) yet can Christian Religion bear it, or Christian ears endure to hear it, that we have no pardon of sin, which was purchased or merited by Christs death and satisfaction, but was fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely given before, by the change of persons? some more I shall say of this in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 9. If we did merit or satisfie (as aforesaid) in Christ, then must our Absolution and Deliverance be <hi>ipso facto</hi> from that moment so compleated, that no Justice can continue us under the least punishment, or inflict the least upon us: But the Consequent is false, and desperately subverteth Religion, and blasphemeth Gods providence: therefore.</p>
               <p>It is easie to argue <hi>à facto ad Jus,</hi> in all Gods Works he doth it: therefore it is Just▪ is an unquestionable consequence. But that God doth inflict castigatory Punishments on Believers; and then doubtless no less on Infidels and wicked men, though Elect, is a truth so plain, that while Scripture is believed, or providence acknowledged, all the Antinomians on earth shall not prevail against it.</p>
               <p>Is it no penalty for God to hate all the Workers of Iniquity? to abominate their Prayers? to deny them all sanctifying Grace? to continue them children of wrath, without hope, without God in the world? Under the power of Satan? yea to be the children of the Divel? 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 10. Act.</hi> 26. 18. and to be led Captive by him at his will, as his bond-slaves? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>He that can make men believe that these men are under no punishment, may next make them believe that there is no God, or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:118986:167"/> Providence, or Hell. Yet is it undenyable that the Redeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all this, and much more (which I have before mentioned and proved at large) so much to the Minor.</p>
               <p>For the Consequence of the Major, it is evident in it self. No Justice can either 1. Continue him under Punishment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or inflict new punishment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or delay his merited happiness, who hath himself in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, fully undergone all the Penalty that was due, and hath fully merited that happiness. He that hath paid all, oweth nothing: and he that ows nothing, cannot justly be continued in Prison. He that hath born all the penalty, or is perfectly Justified or pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is guilty of nothing. And he that is guilty of no fault, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly be punished with the smallest penalty. As Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> truly saith, It may be affliction and torment, but it is no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unless it be for sin and guilt. These men therefore that feign us to have suffered, satisfied and merited in or by Christ, and that for all the sins of our life; and yet that God doth keep us, or suffer us to continue under the power of Satan, and his own wrath; yea, were it but under chastisements, and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and remnants of sin, and doubts and troubles of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they do lay to his charge, that which they durst not do to the sinful Rulers of the Sons of men, whom they account Just and Honest. <hi>Gen. 18. 23, 25. Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? That be far from thee to do after this manner: to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do Right?</hi> Rom. 3. 5, 6, 7, 9. <hi>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who</hi> taketh Vengeance? (<hi>I speak as a man) God forbid: For then how shall God judge the world?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Why am I also judged as a sinner?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are all under sin. 19. What the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may well argue therefore from Gods Justice, thus: They who do justly suffer Gods anger▪ and several punishments for sin, did not perfectly obey or satisfie in or by Christ: But the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after conversion do Justly suffer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The justness of their sufferings for sin, hath been constantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Saints of God. Yea <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13. saith, <hi>And
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:118986:167"/> after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, seeing that thou our God hast</hi> punished us less <hi>then our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deserve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, 9. 7, 11. <hi>O Lord, righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto thee, but unto us, Confusion of face, as at this day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore the Curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. And he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yea, I will argue higher yet. They whose damnation to hell were Just if God should execute it, have not perfectly obeyed or satisfied in and by Christ: But the Damnation of many of the Redeemed (at least, of all the unconverted) were Just: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Major is plain, if we speak of Damnation in proper sense, as a punishment, and not as a meer Torment; for I will not deny but God might do what he would with his own creature, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to his Rector-ship and Covenants. The Minor is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press confession of all humble Christians that ever I spoke with, or heard pray (that mentioned these matters) that God might justly have damned them before conversion (yea and in some respect, since.) And the Apostle speaking of those that say, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come,</hi> or that slandered them as so saying, saith of them. <hi>Whose damnation is just. Rom.</hi> 3. 8. But this is a sin that a Redeemed or Elect man may commit, and the Apostle knew not all the non-Elect from the Elect: therefore the Redeemed may so sin that their Damnation were Just: But that any mans Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can be just, that hath either perfectly obeyed, or else made perfect satisfaction for his sins, is past my apprehension. Yea the Doctrine opposed, accuseth and overthroweth all Penal Laws and Executions of Magistrates, and consequently all Government, and all Common-wealths. For if we have made perfect satisfaction in Christ for all sin, then we owe no more punishment: and then God cannot inflict any by himself or his Instruments. All power is of God; and all Legislation and Judgement of men, is by Gods Commission, if just; Magistrates are Gods Officers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If Gods Justice therefore have nothing against us, mans can have nothing: For mans in Gods. He cannot grant a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to a Magistrate▪ to punish the innocent, or one that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice hath nothing against. The Judgement is the Lords. He rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Soh. Thes.</hi> c. 8. p. 31. So that I must confess, that if this Doctrine of our perfect solution in Christ, and that of the debt it self do not necessarily overthrow all Government, I do not understand it as I thought I had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 10. If we are Justified or Absolved by Meriting or Satisfying in Christ at his death, as aforesaid, then God would not have given us the benefits by Conditional Promises, and have added threatnings of damnation to us, if we rebel: But thus God hath done in his Word; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus: If it be just with God to convey the pardon of sin, and Right to salvation by Conditional Promises, with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings annext: then we are not Justified or Absolved by satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or meriting in or by Christ: but it is Just with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of the Consequence is, because (as is said) to him that hath satisfied or merited fully, the liberation or benefit is due <hi>ipso facto,</hi> presently and absolutely: therefore to make a Law which shall impose Conditions for the obtaining it, and keep us without it till those Conditions are performed, and threaten us with damnation if we perform them not, this seems not equitable, when the thing was our own before, or presently and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due.</p>
               <p>As for them that say, <hi>It is false that these benefits are given upon any Condition.</hi> When I have nothing else to do, I will answer them in folio: till then let this suffice; <hi>Read the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 11. If we are Justified or Absolved by satisfying perfectly, or meriting in or by Christ, as aforesaid, then we are as righteous while we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nfidels, as when we are Christians; and while wicked, as when we are Godly. But the consequent is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>We speak of Righteous here, without equivocation, in the same sense, <hi>viz.</hi> as Relative, as opposite to Guilty, and to having no Right to the Reward The reason of the Consequence is evident: No man can be more just then the most perfectly just. He that hath in Christ perfectly merited or satisfied for all his sins, is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:118986:168"/> Just, (in this Relative sense;) therefore no man can be more just: therefore an Elect Infidel or persecutor, being most Just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can be no more just after.</p>
               <p>I suppose they whom I gainsay, will own it all, as they that have read Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> and <hi>Town,</hi> and <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> may soon see. But so will I never do while the Sun of Scripture shines so bright, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of its evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, with much more, which cryes shame against this opinion: as most of all the texts before cited will bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 12. If we are Justified or Absolved by satisfying or meriting in or by Christ, as aforesaid, then we are as righteous while Infidels, as Christ himself. (I mean with this Relative righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which consisteth in a not-guiltiness: The Law hath no more against us, nor the Judge, then against him) But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is Antinomian: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>He that dare say that every Redeemed or Elect Infidel, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Relatively thus, as righteous as Christ, shall not borrow my tongue to pronounce it. Nay, he that will say, the best Saint on earth is as righteous as Christ, or no more guilty or obliged to any punishment, is not of my Religion. I know the Antinomians are not ashamed of this assertion, (and I know how the Papists cavil with all Protestants, as if they said so too:) But 1. Gods Threatnings and holy Laws. 2. And his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions on body and soul in this life. 3. And the witness of mens own consciences. 4. And the Spirits convincing the world of sin and misery, shall shame and suppress this proud assertion in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the Father of lyes, and his stoutest Instruments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 13. If we are Justified, pardoned or absolved from eternity, or from the time of Christs death (on the foresaid grounds, or any other,) then may we not with any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nfidels or wicked men, in preaching or private conference, convince or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them of their misery, as being under guilt, or not pardoned or absolved, or as having no Right to salvation. But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is Antinomian: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>No man must preach that which he cannot possibly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or false: But no man that should tell any Infidels of the said misery, can tell whether it be true or false: therefore
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118986:169"/> they may not preach it. I suppose they whom I gainsay will grant all this: And what a preaching then we may expect from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, and to what advantage to poor hardened sinners, you may judge. They can tell them no more of their misery, but that they are not Justified in conscience, and that it is uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are absolved or not. It may be you Infidels have Right to salvation, and it may be not, but assurance, feeling and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion you have not: They cannot say without equivocation, you are shut up under sin, and guilty before God, in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bond of iniquity, having no part nor lot in this matter; your damnation is just, the wrath of God abideth on you, you are condemned already, unrighteous, the children of wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is Legal preaching, though to Infidels! They cannot know the Elect Infidels from the Reprobate, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say they are miserable. No nor tell them how they may know it themselves neither: Though <hi>we</hi> could not tell an Hypocrite, that he is miserable, yet we can tell him how himself may know it: but so cannot they, not to the Assemblies of Heathens, nor any one of them; nor of the prophanest men. Only that they want Assurance and Holyness they can tell them: but not that they want <hi>Absolution from guilt of death, and from obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or that they want Right to salvation. Have these men learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to difference between the righteous and the wicked, him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not? Are such Preachers as the mouth of God, that difference no more between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and the vile? yea that call the vile pretious? Is such preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liker to make Saints or Libertines? Make them, did I say? Rather manifest them, and confirm them in Impenitency? I bless God for it, I hear none of this preaching in our Country. I never heard one in the Pulpit tell all the prophane; <hi>For ought you or I can tell, you may all be Absolved from the guilt of death, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Punishment long ago, though not as Terminated in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> And I hope some men that are of this opinion, use not to preach it, yea use to preach contrary. I have so often heard mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Disputers preach soundly and Orthodoxly to the vulgar, that I have loved preaching, (and specially to the vulgar) the better ever since, and disputing comparatively the less: And spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Prayer to God, I do oft hear the Heterodox pray so Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxly, that I am yet more in love with Prayer, and hope that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118986:169"/> many men practise not their ill opinions. If you would hear men speak their hearts, and that which conscience dare own, hear them in Confessions and Prayers to God. Prayers are more generally Orthodox then Sermons, and Sermons <hi>ad populum</hi> then <hi>ad clerum,</hi> and both then Disputations, and Controversal writings, among men that are warping the Antinomian way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 14. If we are Justified, Absolved, or pardoned, and have Right to heaven, from eternity, or from the time of Christs undertaking or suffering, or before our Conversion, then no Jew, Turk, or prophanest man, may lawfully either 1. Believe. 2. Or confess himself miserable, as being not absolved, justified or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or as having no Right to heaven. 3. Nor may they be humbled for any such misery: (except it be those that have blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the Holy-Ghost▪ if any such know their sin:) But the Consequent is purely Antinomian: therefore so is the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>For the Consequence, it is most clear, seeing no man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or confess that which he cannot know whether it be true or false: But no whore-monger, persecutor, murderer, can (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Doctrine) tell whether it be true or false, that he is not absolved, pardoned, and hath Right to heaven: For they say all the Redeemed are absolved, and have such Right: and all and only the Elect are Redeemed: and what wicked man can know that he is not Elect? And therefore it must needs follow that they cannot be humbled for what they cannot know. I doubt not but the Antinomians will be ready enough to own all this; but for experienced humble converts, I need not perswade them of the evil of it: Nor will I bestow more words against it now, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ad populum,</hi> so many of our Divines have spoken to it so abundantly. See <hi>Shephards Sincere believer, Hookers Souls Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, aad Vocation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 15. If we are pardoned, absolved or have Right to heaven from eternity (by the Decree) or from the time of Christs death, then may no man wicked or Godly pray for any such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, absolution, or Right to heaven. But the Consequent is Antinomian: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>Though such a man might pray for Justification as terminated in conscience, or the knowledge or sense of Absolution, and for Possession of heaven, and the <hi>Jus in re,</hi> yet I hope it will not easily
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118986:170"/> go down with Christians, that no man may pray for the thing it felf, as not having it; or that no man may pray for Right to heaven, the <hi>Jus ad rem:</hi> Believers themselves are daily to pray, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Consequence of the Major is apparently sound: For if any may pray for such Pardons, Absolution or Right to heaven, it is either the wicked or the Godly, Infidels or Believers: But neither of these may do it if their Doctrine be true. Not Infidels or any wicked men; for they know not but they may be pardoned and have Right to heaven already, and therefore can pray but for As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance and Continuance (nor for the last neither on their grounds.) Not Believers, for they have the thing already: nay they may not pray for any such pardo or absolution, from any one particular sin which they commit after Faith: Nay they are bound, according to these mens Doctrine, to believe that they were never without such absolution, pardon and Right to heaven, and so may not so much as confess to God, that they were once under this misery while they were Infidels or unregenerate. Thus you see what prayers the Antinomian Doctrine doth require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 16. If we are Absolved from guilt, pardoned or justified, and have Right to heaven from eternity, or from Christs death, then can no man lawfully either hear the word preached, read it, enquire of others, be baptized, or use any other means for that Remission, Absolution or Right to heaven, nor avoid any sin on that account, lest it should hinder them from receiving the said benefits: But the Consequent is purely Antinomian, <hi>viz.</hi> against the scope of Gods Law of Grace, for mans Restauration: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>The reason of the Consequence being the same with the last, I need not repeat it. By this it may appear what kind of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors Antinomianism directeth us to, and what kind of Christians it would make, and of what conversations. What man fearing God dare say to all the Infidels, or enemies to Godliness and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility that he comes neer, <hi>You ought not to do any thing for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Absolution from guilt, and from the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for Right to heaven, or to any benefit of Christs death, for all this is either obtained in and by Christ already, or else is not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; you are not required to do Christs work: it is but manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and</hi> Jus in re <hi>that you are to seek for.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:118986:170"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 17. If we are Absolved, Pardoned, Justified, and have Right to heaven from eternity, or from Christs death, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe, then the same man should at the same time be pardoned and unpardoned, absolved and condemned in Law, have Right to heaven, and have no Right: and that in respect of the same sort of pardon, absolution and Right. But the Consequent is false: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>The Consequence is proved already: for I have proved fully that Absolution, Pardon, Justification, Right to heaven in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title, followeth Faith, and that men are in Law condemned, and unpardoned till they have Faith, and that it is not Justification meerly as terminated in conscience, that Scripture calls <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith:</hi> It must therefore be that in Right of Law; for no other can it be before that, as is shewed. And though I have said so much, I will here add this one Argument more.</p>
               <p>If it were only knowledge or sense of pardon, absolution or Justification in Conscience, that were meant by <hi>Justification by Faith</hi> in Scripture, then we might as well be said, 1. To be Elected by Faith. 2. Or Redeemed <hi>quoad pretium</hi> by Faith. 3. Or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Faith; because by Faith we come to know that we are Elected, Created and Redeemed (yea much more of the two latter, for that we were Created and Redeemed, are <hi>de fide,</hi> proper objects of Faith▪ but so is not our Election or Justification-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal:) But no Scripture saith that we are Elected, Created or Redeemed by Faith (much less so frequently and expresly as it saith we are Justified by Faith;) nor may we say so our selves: therefore it is not knowledge or sense of Justification or Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 18. If we are Absolved, Pardoned, Justified, and have Right to heaven from eternity, or before Faith, then we have all these before we are in Christ, or joyned or united to Christ, or are made his members. But the Consequent is false: therefore so is the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>The Consequence will be denyed, by those that suppose we are in Christ before we believe or are born: But the word of God saith no such matter as they, but much to the contrary. <hi>We are made the Sons of God, heirs and coheirs with Christ by Faith: He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life, and that is they who by not-believing, make God a Lyar. 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 12.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118986:171"/>
                  <hi>Col. 1. 18. Christ is the head of the body, the Church:</hi> but Infidels are not of the body, the Church; for the Church is <hi>Caetus vocato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vel fidelium. Col. 2. 19. From Christ the head, all the body by joynts and bands, having nourishment ministred and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</hi> But Infidels are not so knit to Christ▪ nor receive nourishment nor increase. <hi>Eph. 4. 15, 16. In him which is the head, even Christ: From whom the whole body fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth increase of the body, to the edifying of it self in love.</hi> But none of this is so with Infidels, therefore they are not members, nor joyned to Christ, nor he their head, actually. <hi>Eph. 1. 22. Gave him to be Head over all things. To the Church, which is his body, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of him that filleth all in all.</hi> But so are not Infidels: For what Communion hath Christ with <hi>Belial,</hi> or Infidels? <hi>Ephes. 5. 23▪ 24. As Christ is the Head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body: therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so,</hi> &amp;c. Where we see, that is the Church which is subject to Christ: but so are not Infidels. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27. 12. 13. Now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</hi> And of whom speaks the Apostle? Not of any Infidels, but such as had received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>For by one Spirit ye are all Baptized into one body:</hi> therefore they were not in it before. 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> Infidels are not one Spirit with him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be not joyned to the Lord. So <hi>Eph. 5. 30, 31, 32. Eph. 3. 17. Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> But so are not Infidels: therefore they are not of the family. <hi>Joh. 6. 44, 45. No man cometh to me except the Father draw him: Every man that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh to me.</hi> Infidels therefore be not come to Christ, and therefore have not Right in him as their head. <hi>Joh. 5. 40 Ye will not come to me that ye might have life. Col. 2. 6. As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him.</hi> Infidels have not received him, nor are in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 6▪ 7. &amp;c. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you: If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels therefore are not in Christ. Do we need more Light in so plain a case?</p>
               <p>Yet I deny not but Christ may in some sense be called <hi>ours</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe: That is; All men may truly say, that hear of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:118986:171"/> him, He is our Saviour, or our Redeemer, in that he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or Redeemer of the world: And hath paid a sufficient price for their Ransom, and is offered to them and life with him. The Elect▪ when they come to know that they are Elect, may say, He was our Saviour and Redeemer in a special manner, as absolutely intending our infallible Justification and Salvation. But they can never say till they do believe, <hi>Christ is ours in Covenant, or he is our Head, or Husband,</hi> yea or that they have any true Right to him or in him, more then the rest of the world have. Though he were specially given for them, he is no more given <hi>To</hi> them, before they believe, then to other men.</p>
               <p>For the Minor (that we have not Absolution, Pardon or Right to heaven, before we have Christ▪ by true Donation, or Covenant-Right) I take it to be so much proved already, so exceeding evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in many more Texts of Scripture, and so generally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by all the Orthodox, that it seems but loss of time to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 19. If we had been pardoned, Absolved, or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and had Right to heaven from eternity, or before we were born, then would <hi>Paul</hi> or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me of the Apostles have made use of this, as an Argument against Justification by the works of the Law, or at least, not have pleaded against it, only Justification by Faith, which implyes that we were not before Justified▪ or Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But neiether <hi>Paul</hi> nor any of the Apostles did ever make use of such an Argument against Justification by the Works of the Law; but contrarily plead only Justification by Faith: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>How easily might <hi>Paul</hi> have silenced all pretences of the works of the Law to Justification, by proving that we were Justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was Law or man or at least before we were born and capable of working?

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 20. That Doctrine is not of God, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hroweth the Kingly▪ Priestly and Prophetical office of Christ, at
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118986:172"/> least, as to a very great part of their work. But so doth the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctrine which we are opposing: therefore.</p>
               <p>The Minor (which only needeth proof) shall be proved thus in its several parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Kingly office of Christ, the exercise of it over his Church consisteth 1. In Legislation. 2. Judgement. 3. Execution of Judgement. 4. In Relaxation of Laws, (or abrogation of them) when he sees cause. 1. In Legislation he 1. determineth what shall be <hi>due from</hi> man, by his precepts: and 2. what shall be due to man, in his Promises and Threats; and what shall be the Condition of these. 1. The great and eminent use of the Law of Grace, is to be Gods Instrument to make over to us Christ with his benefits, of Pardon, Absolution, Justification, Adoption, Right to Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this is overthrown, by feigning that all these are ours already; and therefore what need we any Promise, Testament, Deed of Gift, Covenant, or Law of Grace, to make them ours? And if we our selves satisfied in Christ Legally, then we must have present Right in all the benefits <hi>ipso facto.</hi> 2. These Promises and Conveyances God hath made on condition of faith and Repentance. This act of Christ (the Constituting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) is also made void and vain▪ if not unjust, as being to men that had an Absolute Right before. 3. The Threats of non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n-Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we believe not, or if we draw back, are also made void and vain, if not accused of flat injustice, as Threatning men with the loss of that which was Absolutely their own before, and the word of the Immutable God engaged for it. 4. And it is a very great doubt whether all Gods precepts be not accused of injustice, or at least▪ the keeping of them of no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to salvation; if we our selves have (in sense of Law, or the Law-giver) already perfectly obeyed them all to the death in Christ, or perfectly satisfied for not obeying them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods Judgement is according to his Laws, which are the Rule of Judgement. All the Accusations therefore, that fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Laws, must fall upon the Judgement. When men have Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Absolution before they were born, and Absolute Right to Heaven, to Judge them a new, upon Conditional Promises, and adjudge that to them as upon that performance of a Condition (of feeding, cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, loving and obeying Christ-believed in) this seemeth contradictory to the rules of equity.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:118986:172"/>3. The Execution is partly by temporal chastisements in this life (which antecede solemn Judgement) and partly, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reward and punishment: For the former, I have said enough before. They manifestly accuse all the penal Castigations of the Elect, of injustice: if they had fully obeyed or satisfied in Christ: and if they were perfectly Absolved and pardoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And it is a charging that on God which he abhorreth in his Word, to say that the Reason why the Reprobate were damned, was not for refusing a Redeemer, or for not performing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions prescribed, that they might have had part in that sufficient price of Ransom, but it was meerly for sinning against the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied Law of Works, and as the Devils do perish, as having no Remedy, nor any expiatory sacrifice that ever was offered for them.</p>
               <p>And that all the Reason of the Adjudging the Elect to heaven, is taken from their being absolutely justified or absolved in Christ, and having a Right to heaven by meer Decree and Purchase, and not upon any Conditional Promise after, nor <hi>because they were faithful in a very little. Luk.</hi> 19. 17▪ This Doctrine so contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth Christs Judgement and Reward (which he giveth to every man, and according to his Works) that both of them cannot be Justified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The other part of Christs Kingly Power, is to be above his own Laws, though not to dispence with them without a valuable consideration (which he will not do) yet to Relax them by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sins, upon a valuable consideration. This Power hath God exercised in Enacting the Law of Grace, or granting the Promise of pardon of all sins against the former Laws, on condition of our accepting Christ and Grace. The foresaid Doctrine denyeth this Conditional Remission, and disableth God from making any such, because the thing is Absolutely our own before.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how it would unthrone Christ, feigning him to make all to be ours so absolutely on the Cross, that he cannot give them out to us as Rector on conditional Promises, backt with penalties threatned, that is, on terms, and by wayes that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming a King and Governor of the world, and Judge of all men, nor as may be fitted to promote the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:118986:173"/>2. And but little better doth the said Doctrine deal with Christs Priestly office, to which yet it seemeth to give almost all. For whereas Christ is purposely described by the holy Church to be a Priest for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedek▪</hi> it is a doubt whether they deny him not to be a Priest at all: For it was the office of the Priest to act as a middle person on behalf of the people, and for their good, but not in the very person of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so as that in Law the sinner did what the Priest did; further then as consent or request did make the Priest his Instrument. But these men rather make Christ our Delegate then our Priest; as if he had been one sent by us, to do and suffer in our person and stead.</p>
               <p>But suppose that they do honor the exercise of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood on the Cross; do they not deny him the honor of it ever after in heaven? It is the office of Christ, as Priest after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> to be still making Intercession for us with God: by which Intercession he procureth us pardon of sin when we believe, and Absolution or Justification, Adoption-Right to heaven; also he procureth us a renewed Pardon for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sin afterward; and the Continuation of the first: All this is denyed by these men to his Priestly Intercession with God, and pretended to be done on the Cross before we were born: as if it were nothing but the knowledge or sense of these that Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion procureth, with sanctification and possession of the glory that we had before a Right to. <hi>Heb. 7. 24, 25. He hath an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Priesthood; Wherefore he is able also to save them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for them.</hi> What man that honoreth Christs Priesthood, and knows the present need we have still of it, dare say, that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Intercession of Christ to procure him the Pardon of any one sin with God, (all being done already) but only the sense of this in our consciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prophetical Office of Christ is exercised, by his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Ministers without, and his Spirit within; the work of all which is, to teach us his Will or Laws; even all things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he commanded: <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20, 21. This Doctrine therefore which doth, as is aforesaid, subvert the Laws themselves, and the Doctrine which should be taught, doth contradict Christs teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Word, Ministry and Spirit. If he teach us the nature of his Covenant, and the Conditions on which we must expect his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:118986:173"/> blessings, these men deny all, and say, It is false: If he teach us what means we must use to attain Absolution from guilt of death, or Obligation to punishment, and to get Right to heaven, they rise against it, and say, We have all this already: there is therefore no means to be used to obtain it. The like may be said of other particulars.</p>
               <p>I hope by this time it appears how little the Lord Redeemer is exalted and honoured by their mistaken way of honouring him: and how much they detract from the honor of his Intercession, Teaching and Kingly Government, his Laws, Judgements, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Remissions, while they mistakingly ascribe all to his Death and Merits. <note n="*" place="margin">Yea, I have shewed before how they also destroy his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits on the Cross, by making Absolution or Pardon to be from eternity.</note> And that all is not an exalting of Christ and free Grace that pretends to be so: And that no way of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising is fit to exalt him, but only that way which his wisdom hath determined of.</p>

That we are Justified, Absolved, or Pardoned at the time of Christs death, and so before our being. 3. Or at least before our Conversion and believing. 4. That we our selves did in Gods esteem, or in Law-sense, perfectly obey, or suffer and satisfie in Christ: and so that Christ paid the same thing that the Law required of us, and not only satisfied for our not payment, by giving such a sacrifice to God as might be a valuable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, on which he might grant us the benefits, on such Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are most sutable to his ends and honor: For though some have said, that it is not <hi>tantidem,</hi> a matter worth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about, whether Christs satisfaction were the <hi>Idem</hi> or <hi>Tantundum,</hi> yet I take it to be of no less moment then all these haynous Consequents beforementioned do declare, and even to subvert the substance of Religion. The <hi>Idem</hi> is the perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or the full Punishment of man himself; and in case of personal Disobedience, it is personal punishment that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118986:174"/> It is <hi>Supplicium ipsius Delinquentis.</hi> The Law never threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Surety: Nor granteth any liberty of substitution: that was an Act of God as Above the Law. If therefore the thing due were paid, it was we our selves Morally or Legally that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and it could not be our selves Legally, because it was not our selves Naturally. But if it had been our selves Legally, then the strictest Justice could not have denyed us a present and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dliverance <hi>ipso facto,</hi> seeing no Justice can demand more then the <hi>Idem quod d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that all may take heed of this unhappy model of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie that these men have framed, I would earnestly commend to their Consideration this following advice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Still keep in your minds a clear Distinction between Gods Rectoral or Legislative Will determining <hi>de D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; Eventu</hi> as such, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining <hi>de facto</hi> what shall be, and what not; Or between Gods Decrees and his Laws. And take heed of confounding these in any point of Theologie; much more in the whole frame. For ought I see, Gods Eternal Decree is the beginning, middle and end of the Antinomians Theologie; It is almost their All.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Distinguish carefully between that Decree, Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, call it which you will, whereby the Father did, as it were, appoint unto his Son both his work and Reward; and that Law, or Covenant by which both Father and Son do Govern the Church, and make over to us the parts of our salvation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding these hath lost the Antinomians in their Theologie: so that so much of Gods Covenants as they do take notice of, is little more then the Promise of the Father to the Son, and the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute discovery of▪ his Decree. They reduce almost all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants to this, and denominate all from this.</p>
               <p>And the very nature of the Thing, as well as the plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, proclaimeth to us this great Truth, which once more I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat all men that read this well to consider of.</p>
               <p>That, <hi>As it was not the sinner himself, nor any Servant or Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of his, but Christ the Mediator upon Gods Mission and his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Sponsion, who bore the Penalty, and made satisfaction to God; so it was meet that the fruits of this satisfaction should not be delivered by God immediately to the sinner, but sinners and all into
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118986:174"/> the hands of the Redeemer; That all they shall receive might come to them through his hands, and come from him, as it was purchased by him. And that as dearly as God loved mankind, he did more dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love his own righteousness and glory, and therefore did all this more principally for it, then for us▪ and therefore in his way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, would do all on terms most beseeming his honor: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still to continue the Gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rnment of the world, he thought meet to make the same person Governor and Benefactor, King and Saviour; that so he might Reign with saving, and save with Reigning, and give out his mercies, not by meer Absolute gifts, but by Laws and Grants Conditional, which might hold men to duty: That so as there is a blessed conjunction of Benefactor and Rector, Saviour and King in the Head▪ there might also be an answerable conjunction in the Members, of love and loyalty, thankfulness and Obedience▪ Read</hi> Rom. 14. 9. Joh. 13. 3. Math. 28. 18, 19 20, 21. Joh. 5. 22. and 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. with recital of which one Text I will conclude this matter. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar, because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son. And this is the Record; that God hath given to us eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is in order of Nature. 1. Gods Record of his Son. 2. Some mens believing it, and others not believing it. 3. The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their not believing. 4. The different Consequents of Believing and not Believing. 1. The Record is in these two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. 1. That God hath given us eternal Life. This Life is Justification, Sanctification, and Glorification. By <hi>us</hi> must needs be meant mankind in general, and not only the Elect: For some make God a Lyar in not believing it: which cannot be in not believing a thing as concerning others meerly▪ and not themselves. By giving therefore must needs be meant Radically and Causally, and not formally every benefit: which appears in the second part of the Record, which is, that This life is in his Son: so that God hath not immediately given life into our hands, but to Christ for us, to give out unto us as he seeth meet. Now Remission, and Justification, as ours, cannot be formally in Christ, nor Right to heaven, but causally and potentially. God hath given us over actually to Christ, and given him Power and Right to give us life,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118986:175"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> of Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, and glory. So that all is in Christs hands, and not ours, till we have him. 2. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of this Record is, that some believe, and some do not. 3. The sin of those that believe not is aggravated, in that they make God a Lyar. 4. The different Consequents are, that <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Where note, 1. That it is plainly implyed, that the Believers have the Son, and the unbelivers have not: and therefore the former are said to have the witness in themselves, and the latter to make God a Lyar. As <hi>Joh. 3. 36. He that believeth on the Son hath everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life: and he that believeth not the Son</hi> (or obeyeth him not, or is not perswaded by him) <hi>shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And v. 18. <hi>He is condemned already.</hi> 2. Note that upon our believing, first we have the Son, <hi>viz.</hi> In Covenant Right as our Head and Husband, and acknowledged King and Saviour, and then we have life with him. 3. Note, that all they that have not by Faith received the Son, have not life, though they may be Elect thereto. That is, They are yet under both Guilt and Power of sin and death: They have not the Life of Remission or Absolution, nor the Life of Holyness, nor Right to the Life of Glory: For it is the word received that is able to save our souls, and to give us an Inheritance among the sanctified. And we are then <hi>made meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> When God <hi>hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have Redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.</hi> That is, by the Merit of his blood-shed, when we are so translated into the Kingdom of Christ. For as on the shedding of his blood, Christ receiveth Authority to forgive us: so upon our belief in his blood, we are actually forgiven: And therefore it is more then the shedding of his blood, (even the Application also) which the Saints shall glorifie him for in eternity, even <hi>Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: Ʋnto him that hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Father, to him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever,</hi> Amen. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>

               <head>SECT. I.</head>
               <p>I Am now come to the last part of my undertaken task, to shew the world whether I be singular or not, by producing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> of Churches and Divines, in the chief point in question! At least me thinks I may promise my self this success; that I shall not be judged to love singularity, nor to desire to hear an <hi>Ego primus inveni,</hi> to be honored as the first inventer of any opinion, much less to be the leader of a party, while I do so ambitiously endeavour to perswade men that the opinion which I maintain is so common, as that it is owned by such an Army of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines; and that I do but come after them all in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of it. It shall appear that I affect not to stand alone.</p>
               <p>Before I come to cite the words of others, I must tell you to what end I do it, and therefore I must tell you what is my own opinion which is suspected to deviate from the judgement of the Orthodox.</p>
               <p>It is not only the Antinomians that I have now to deal with in this Chapter; but it is those Brethren whom I highly honour, whose judgements I more esteem. I confess it is Scripture that turns the scales of my judgement, and not mens opinions: though I shall still bear a Reverend regard to the judgement of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Godly, as being such as are meet to be my Teachers, and of whom I am unfeignedly willing to learn. But the reason of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:118986:176"/> my reciting these Testimonies, is to be a Pill to Prejudice, and open mens ears to Scripture-proof. It is not a few, nor only the unlearned and ungodly, who are mastered by prejudice in these disputable things. Were not the Power of prejudice wonderful, we should not see the Divines of one Nation all Lutherans, as <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Saxonie,</hi> &amp;c. and of another all Calvinists, as they are called; and of so many all Papists: and none or so few to depart from the way in Credit where they live. I confess I find in experience, that it doth more with most objectors, to cite the plain words of a Divine in Credit, then of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul:</hi> When I mention what Christ saith, they make a puff at it, and say, <hi>That is your Exposition? but what say such and such Divines?</hi> As if Scriptures and humane Authority were of the same account in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Italie!</hi> I speak not this of all; but of too many: Nor do I speak it to accuse them, but as the necessary reason of my following task, which they who know not our common case, may judge superfluous and vain.</p>
               <p>The opinions which are excepted against in me, are those which are supposed to ascribe too much to man and his Actions in the matter of Justification. Which are especially these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>1. That we are justified by believing the truth of the Gospel, and accepting Christ as offered therein, that is, as an entire Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to save us from sin it self, as well as from guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as a King to Rule us: and so that subjecting the soul to Christ by Consent to his Kingdom, is an Act of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are justified, as well as resting on him for Justification, or apprehending or accepting pardon and righteousness. And that it is utterly void of Scripture-warrant to say, that It is only the Accepting of Christs sacrifice, or Imputed Righteousness, which is the justifying Act: or else, only the resting upon it for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Or that though <hi>fides quae Iustificat, Recepit Christum ut Regem,</hi> Faith which Justifieth, taketh Christ for Lord: yet <hi>Qua Iustificat,</hi> as it justifieth, it taketh him only to Justification.</p>
               <p>The ground of my opinion here is misliked, which is this. 2. <hi>Faith doth not Justifie</hi> qua fides, <hi>or</hi> qua haec fides, <hi>as this Faith, that is, as it is an apprehending or accepting of Christs righteousness, nor is our Right to each particular Benefit of Christ particularized and constituted by the partitular object apprehended by Faith, as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:118986:176"/> Impressions are made on the soul in sanctification, and individuated by individual objects, and specified by special objects; and so it is not as an Instrumental efficient cause that Faith Justifieth (for such it is not) nor yet formally from its natural act of Reception of such an object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Right to Christ and Life being a Moral effect, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Moral cause and way, that is, by a Law of Grace, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promise or gift; therefore the formal reason of Faiths Interest in our Justification is, as it is the Condition of that Promise by us performed: and its Essence, or Physical act, (the Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ and life) commonly called its instrumentality, though it be the Reason why it was chosen and preferred to this office of being the Condition of the Promise, yet is it but its apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the office, and so the remote, and as it were, material reason of its Interest in our Justification, and not the formal Reason. And therefore so far as it is a Condition of pardon or Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it must needs be the pardoning or justifying act: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being the undivided and undistinguished acceptance of Christ as Christ; that is, as Lord-Redeemer and Saviour, which is by Scripture made the Condition of our Right to Christ and his benefits, it follows, that we are justified by receiving him for Lord, as well as for Justifier by satisfaction, and that it is besides and against Scripture to say, that Faith Justifieth as an Instrument, or as it hath the Physical respect of an act to such an object; that is, as it apprehendeth Christs righteousness, and resteth thereon, or as it is Faith in Christ as a Justifier.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As that Faith which is the Condition of our first Right to a state of Justification, is the accepting of Christ as Christ, and so as King, and so contains the entering our selves by Consent into the Relation of subjects hereafter to obey, and a disposition and resolution to obey; so in those that survive, sincere obedience, (which is the performance of this Covenant) is the Condition, 1. Of our not losing our state of Justification, or of continuing it. 2. Of our particular pardon of particular sins, (at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Repentance is such.) 3. And of our great Justification by Sentence at Judgement. But it is but a meer remote and secondary part of the Condition, in some subordination to faith, whereof it is a fruit. So that there is more required to the continuance and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:118986:177"/> consummation of our Justification, then is to put us into a Justified state at first.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The performance of the Conditons of the New Covenant, for Justification and salvation (by Faith, Repentance, sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience) are a personal, evangelical righteousness (commonly called Inherent); and therefore is it called our righteousness, because it is the performance of the Gospel condition, (rather then from its Relation to the Law or Covenant of works, which it violateth by its imperfection) seeing whosoever believeth and repenteth is <hi>non Reus,</hi> not guilty of the non-performance of the Condition of Justification, and he that also sincerely obeyeth to the end, is not guilty of the non-performance of the Conditions of sentential Absolution in Judgement.</p>
               <p>It is not that Law (commonly called Moral or of works) which saith, <hi>Obey perfectly, or else dye;</hi> which judgeth me righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my Inherent qualifications, or imperfect obedience: but it is that Law, which saith, <hi>He that repenteth and believeth shall be forgiven, and he that sincerely obeyeth, (both naturally Moral, and supernatural precepts) and endureth to the end, shall be saved.</hi> This Law or Covenant pronounceth me righteous, upon my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect performances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This righteousness is not our universal righteousness, nor the matter of our Justification against the Accusation of violating the Law of works, nor any part of satisfaction for such violation: but only it is first the Condition of our Interest in that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (of Christ) and consequently a special particular righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, constituting us truly righteous; but only <hi>in tantum,</hi> so far as not to be chargeable with the final non-performance of the conditions of the new Covenant; that is, not to be guilty of final Impenitency, Infidelity, Rebellion, or Hypocrisie. And in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is only against this false accusation that we must be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it, as the matter of our righteousness; and against the charge of violating the Law of works, or being in general sinners, it is Christs righteousness that must justifie us, as the only merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause or matter, and this of ours no otherwise then as the Condition <hi>sine qua non,</hi> of our Right in it: Yet when in order to our final universal Absolution, the question comes to be, Whether we have any Right in Christ or not? And so whether we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:118986:177"/> the Condition of that grant or Promise, which giveth Right? Here that Faith and Repentance, which first are but Conditions of our Justification by Christ, do next become the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter of that righteousness whereby we are Justified, against the particular accusation of being Infidels, Impenitent, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, or Hypocrites, and such as never performing the Condition have no Right in Christ. So that it is only in subordination to Christ and his righteousness, that we are to be justified by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Righteousness: As it is in subordination to him, that we are now said to be constituted <hi>in tantum,</hi> personally (or Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently righteous) by our being sincere Believers, penitent and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>And thus I have truly given the very summe of my judgement in this matter, which is accepted against by some Brethren; In all which, 1. I make neither Faith, nor any act of man, to be the least causes of our justified state, or of continuing it, or of our final Absolution. 2. Nor do I take works of Obedience to Christ to be so much as present in our first Justification, but in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to follow it.</p>
               <p>The main thing that I find offend, are these two. 1. That I say, The Accepting Christ as King, and Teacher, is part of that Faith which is the Condition of Justification, and so justifying as well as the taking his righteousness. 2. That I say, Obedience to God Redeemer, is a secondary part of the Condition of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or not losing of our justified state, and of our final Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at judgement. It is therefore these two that I shall espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially endeavour to prove that I am not singular in.</p>
               <p>And lest you should imagine that I wrong any Authors by forcing their words, or leaving out any thing. 1. I will suppose you to have the books at hand to peruse the whole context, which I cannot have time to write, or suppose concern me not. 2. I will not undertake to reconcile all other passages in any book with what I cite, but if I force their words, I am contented to bear the blame. 3. I will annex the conclusion which I gather from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, lest you say, I cite each one as approving my whole cause. 4. But all shall drive at the proofs of this Truth, that <hi>I give no more to Works, then the most eminent Reformed Divines ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, though perhaps I give less to Faith and Man.</hi>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to any particular testimonies, let me tell you, that I suppose that I have virtually the consent of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines, and that in sense and substance they say as much for Works in the matter of Justification as I do: And that this may appear. I will mention 14 particular Doctrines that all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants (for ought I know) agree in; every one of which, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, containeth in it as much as I maintain in this; much more all together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first common assertion is this: <hi>That all the Faithful have a true inherent righteousness, consisting in internal Graces or holyness, and external obedience, and that it is in an evangelical respect, that this is esteemed Righteousness and Accepted, seeing the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth perfection, and curseth all that continue not in all things to do them; and our best Works are mortally sinful in the sense of the Law of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being the common Doctrine of Protestants. 1. What wants it of giving as much to man in point of personal Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal righteousness, as I do? 2. If it be truly and not equivocally righteousness, it must needs have a Metaphysical perfection inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from its Essence. 3. If it be truly righteousness, then we are truly justified by it, beyond all doubt: that is, 1. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutively justified by it <hi>in tantum,</hi> so far and no further: Not constituted universally righteous by it; but we are constituted evangelically inherently righteous, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o far as that extends. For it is a meer contradiction to say a man hath a righteousness that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes him not righteous: that is, He is righteous, and he is not righteous, in respect to the same righteousness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This righteousness will undeniably justifie him in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the particular accusation of having not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition of the new Covenant, that is, of being a final Infidel, Rebel, Hypocrite: And <hi>Math.</hi> 25. and many other Scriptures make it appear, that to judge men to have performed or not performed those Conditions (that is according to their Works evangelically) will be no small part of the work of Christ in that judgement. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:118986:178"/> we are constituted, pardoned sinners, purely by Christs Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and not any thing of our own; so we are constituted evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically, Inherently righteous, as being performers of the new Covenants Conditions of our Interest in Christ and Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Initially (but actually) on our first believing, and Progressively, as we bring forth the fruits of that Faith. And as at judgement we shall be pronounced Pardoned sinners, and therefore not to be condemned meerly as sinners, (which term I oppose to the special excepted sins of final Infidelity and Impenitency, or Rebellion,) and this for the sake of Christs blood alone: So we shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Believers, and sincere Obeyers, because we were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and acquit from all false accusations of non-performance of the Gospel Condition, because we did perform it, and therefore are righteous in that cause, against that accusation.</p>
               <p>2. THe second common assertion is this, <hi>That as every man</hi>

                  <hi>may have a particular righteousness, and so a righteous cause in Judgement; so every man may be said most truly and properly to be justified in Judgement by a particular justification (if need be) by that particular righteousness, or justness of his cause.</hi> No man ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed but that the Divel himself may be falsly accused: and so may any wicked man: I do not say, that it is any of the business of that day to vindicate them from such accusations: It is another work that will be then in hand. But you may see that they are so far Justifiable as they are just! If one accuse me of killing a man in <hi>India</hi> that I never heard of, may I not be justified before God, or man from that charge, by my innocency or righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? No doubt of it. If therefore we be accused at judgement of not performing the Conditions of the Law of Grace, and so of having no part in Christs Merits, we must be justified by our Faith, Repentance and Obedience, as that matter or righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our cause, and so of our persons. If any dream that there will be no use at judgement of any such Justification. 1. Yet they concede that such we may have, if it were useful. 2. I am far from their opinion, seeing, 1. It is the Law of Grace that we shall be judged by; and therefore our Absolution or Condemnation must be upon its Conditions. The Law is the Rule of Judgement.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:118986:179"/> 2. What can it else be? 1. We shall not be justified or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Law of Works. 2. I will not exclude the mention of Christs satisfaction, but principally include it as supposed: but by the descriptions of that judgement expressed in the word, it seems it is not the business of that day to enquire, whether Christ have done his part, but whether we have done ours: not whether Christ have satisfied, but whether we have believed and obeyed him in Love and Gratitude? The former being taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not need a Judicial Decision. The judgement will proceed according to the Law which is <hi>Norma Judicii:</hi> But the Law which we shall then be judged by, supposeth Christ to be our Redeemer, and to have made satisfaction, and is founded on that ground, being the Lord▪ Redeemers Law: therefore the judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Law will suppose it too; and as he made the Law as Rector on his Redemption Right, so will he Judge on the same Right in the same Relation. 3. The Scripture expresly tells us that it is according to our Works, that we shall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as we have well or ill used our Talents, which are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers mercies; and as we have loved him, and manifested it to his members, <hi>Math. 25 &amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is certain that there will be use at that day for a Justification, as against the Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of non-performance of the Gospel-Conditions. Whether the accusation it self will be actual, or only Potential and Virtual, is little to the matter: Christ tells us the Justification opposite to it shall be actual and express.</p>
               <p>4. And what else can our Divines mean, when they so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly say, that Works shall be then mentioned as evidences of true Faith, and shall Justifie Faith? By that it seems they suppose that Faith it self directly will be tryed, and Works in relation to it. This therefore is opposite to the (actual or virtual) Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are Infidels and Rebels.</p>
               <p>3. THe third common assertion is this, <hi>That Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, is a Condition without which we cannot be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: The same many say of Love to God as our end and chief good, and Love to Christ as Redeemer, and thankfulness for his mercie, and desire after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:118986:179"/>
               <p>This granteth the thing that I contend for, or that men are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me for asserting. For in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, I ever disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Works from Justifying, that is, either 1. Mosaical ceremonious Works. 2. Or exact righteousness according to the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (no man having such.) 3. Or any conceited to be such. 4. Or any conceited meritorious, and making the Reward to be not of Grace but of Debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 4. But if by Works, you will mean any good action, I say that as Faith, so in their places Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Gratitude for the offer of Life, and desire and love to the object of Faith, are Conditions without which we cannot be saved or justified. And do not themselves say as much? Or dare any say otherwise except the Antinomians, that are for Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels Justification? If you say, <hi>But Faith only is the Instrument, and not Repentance, Love,</hi> &amp;c. I <hi>Answ.</hi> I never said that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Love were Instruments of Justifying us. <hi>Obj.</hi> But you say that Faith is not, and so you level them. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Lay the blame then where it should lye, and speak the truth: say that I deny that Faith justifieth us as the Instrumental cause, and say that I give less to Faith, and so to man in Justification then others do; and do not say I give more to other acts, as Repentance, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When you know that others make them <hi>sine qua non,</hi> and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conditions as well as I. 2. I have told you in my account to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> how far I deny Faith to be an Instrument, and how far I will contend with no man that useth the word, and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for both, and that I give it the honor of being the Receiving Condition.</p>
               <p>4. THe fourth assertion warranting my opinion, is this, <hi>That we are justified by Faith as long as we live, even by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and continued Believing, and not only by the first instantaneous act of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I never met with man that denyed this: How absurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture is it, to say, that no man hath justifying Faith above one minute or instant of his life (as to the act)? Or that all our after believing doth no more to our Justification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don then our Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks do, (in their account, which is nothing, as they expresly say?) Am not I warranted from this Doctrine of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:118986:180"/> theirs then to affirm, 1. That Justification is a continued act? 2. That there is more requisite to the continuance of it, then was to the beginning? For it was one numerical act of Faith that sufficed (in its kinde) to the beginning: but it must be many renewed acts, even through our lives, that are necessary for its continuance: And certainly believing all our lives, or perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Habit, and renewing daily the acts, is somewhat more then to perform the first act of justifying-Faith.</p>
               <p>5. A Fifth assertion of theirs is this, <hi>That renewed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, especially for gross sins, is a</hi> causa sine qua non, <hi>or necessary Condition of our pardon for particular sins after Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Also that Prayer for pardon is the like Condition, and means to procure pardon: Also that Confession of sin is the like condition that God may forgive them: And that restitution of ill gotten, stoln goods (where it may be done) is the like Condition, to which end it is ordinarily urged, as from</hi> Austin, Non remittitur peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum: <hi>without restitution there is no Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. (A cutting conclusion, saith Mr.</hi> R. Bolton, <hi>to all cut-throat Ʋsurers.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Now let but any one of all these be granted, and I am war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to say, 1. That somewhat else besides Faith is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Condition of pardon of sin, which they say is essential to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. 2. That somewhat more is required to renewed and continued pardon, then to the first. 3. That therefore (absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unlimitedly) it is not fit to say that pardon or Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perfect at once, or as long as we are sinners, and have more sins (<hi>future</hi>) to be pardoned, and more means to be used both for continuance and renewal of pardon. What man dare say, I will never pray for the continuance of my pardon, Justification, or Gods favour and Acceptance? I hope many of those dare not do thus when it comes to practice, whose disputing principles lead them to it. And surely as long as means must be used, the end is not obtained (unless they were <hi>media fruitionis,</hi> in heaven:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while you must pray for continued Justification and renewed pardon or Justification from the guilt of particular sins, all this is yet unobtained, and your Justification not of the most perfect
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:118986:180"/> kind. And yet I am deeply blamed for saying, there is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to continue our Justification, and consummate it, then to begin it: and that it is not Absolutely perfect at first.</p>
               <p>6. ANother common Assertion of our Divines is, that, <hi>If a true Believer should fall to gross Rebellion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and fall away from Grace, and from sincere Obedience to Christ, he should cease to be Justified: If he should lose his Sanctification, he should with it lose his Justification: And that it ought to be our care and daily study that we fall not away, and that on this motive, lest we lose Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know none but gross Antinomians deny this. And I blame them not to hold it, when God saith, <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye: and if any draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> &amp;c. And will not this beyond all question, warrant us to say, that sincere obedience is a Condition of the continuance or not losing our Justification? This is but the same thing in other words which they say themselves: and yet this is my great and haynous offence! I hope these sober men will not say, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it shall never come to pass that the justified shall lose their justification, it is therefore a supposition not to be put: yet I meet with such freaks in some Antinomians. The certainty of the end, supposeth the certainty of the means: and those means must be intended for that end: and therefore we may well suppose that the end would not be obtained without the means: and he that will not put such suppositions, is like to use the means but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. He that will not say, If I should not forbear sin, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duty, I should miss of heaven, would scarce use them well, I think: And he that scrupleth, to think or say, If Christ had not Redeemed me, if God had not called me, and justified me, I had perished for ever. I think will be likely to perish, or is at least very unthankful: and yet these suppositions are as impossible, as our falling away. It is impossible we should not be redeemed and called now it is past: and it was as certain before, that what God had purposed must come to pass; and impossible that any thing should frustrate his decrees. Yet who knows not that such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are not only lawful, but necessary to the right
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:118986:181"/> actuating of our mindes, and the Exercise of all Gods Graces in us.</p>
               <p>7. ANother common assertion is, that, <hi>The Faith which justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth must take Christ for King and Prophet, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier as well as a sacrifice for sin: and that this is required of God, as a matter of so great necessity, as that he will not justifie us without it: yea it is no true justifying Faith without it.</hi> Yet they say, we are not justified by it, because this is not the act which apprehendeth Christs righteousness: this is <hi>fides quae Iustificat,</hi> but not <hi>qua Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificat:</hi> this is not the Instrument, nor the act related to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which must justifie.</p>
               <p>And do they not here say as much as I? (Though I say not so much as they.) Either I understand it not, or else this confesseth that accepting Christ as Lord and King, is a Condition of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, though it be not the Instrument of it? And did ever I say, it was the Instrument of it? If I deny the Instrumentality of another act as to Justification, doth it thence follow that I give more then they to this act?</p>
               <p>8. THe next assertion which they own, is, <hi>That the will of man cannot desire evil as evil, nor refuse that good which they see to have only</hi> rationem boni: <hi>that man cannot hate himself directly, and will his own damnation. Or at least, that a man may will his own salvation, or escape of Torments without saving Grace: and therefore that even an unregenerate man may be Willing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, justified and saved from hell; but he cannot be willing to be sanctified, obedient, and healed of his corruptions. Also they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Gods Glory is his only or highest end in all his Works, and that he cannot intend the Creature before his Glory.</hi> Rom. 14. 9.</p>
               <p>And if all this be so, is it not much liker, if we must needs make a distinction in the matter, that God rather intended the Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ as King, to be more the Condition of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the accepting him as pardoner or justifier? For the Condition and the benefit are usually thus different, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:118986:181"/> contains that which the party apprehendeth more good in, and the condition that which he is prone to apprehend some evil in, or some more difficulty or inconvenience: and in the condition the promiser useth to see to his own interest. If we suffer with him, we shall also be Glorified with him. Suffering is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill that must be licked down with the promise of Glory annexed: God would not say, if you will consent to be glorified with him, you shall suffer with him. If we confess Christ before men, he he will confess us, or own us before his Father and the Angels; but if we deny him, he will deny us. Confessing him in dangerous times, is the pill that must be licked down with the promise of his owning us. These promises suppose that the party is willing of the thing promised, but not so willing of the thing conditioned; and therefore the benefit expected must procure the condition performed. God saith not, if you will consent that I confess you before the Angels, and not deny you then you shall have leave to confess me in dangers. Lay all this to the case in hand. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to assent savingly to the truth of the Gospel, which is the Intellectual foregoing act, is a matter of so g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat difficulty, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at none can do it but by special Grace. But suppose believing the the truth of the word, (if it be but with a common temporary faith) can you prove that those men cannot be willing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by Christ and saved from Hell, without speciall Grace? What man is willing to be damned, or unpardoned? If disputing serve not turn, go try them, and believe them as far as reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you: ask all the Town, how many of you would not have your sins pardoned? How many would go to hell? Who can Imagine then, that the chief intent of the promiser, was to make that the main or only condition, which men are all willing of by nature, or can perform by nature (if that were all, and if they first believed the truth of the word) is it not much liker, that God principally intended that act that flesh and blood apprehendeth to be against them? and which they do most stick at? yea, and which tendeth most directly to the securing of the interest and honour of the Redeemer? that is, to take him for our King and Guide, and to obey him? Physitians use to say, if you will take me for your Physitian and trust me and take my Medicines, and follow my directions, I will cure you (if they can.) But they use not to say, if you are willing to be cured, or on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:118986:182"/> you will consent to be well; I will be your▪ Physitian, and give you this Medicine, perhaps bitter and unpleasant. Yet for my part I speak not this, as thinking it meet to make any partition in this business, nor to separate what God hath joyned: I think it fittest to say that it is receiving Christ as he is Offered, that is the condition, even whole Christ with the whole heart: even against his pardoning Grace, nature may rise indirectly and by accident: but if we were necessitated to make a difference or separation, and must make one only or chiefly the condition of Pardon, it seems it would be rather willingness to be ruled, then to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
               <p>9. Another common Assertion is this, that 1. <hi>Refusing Christs Reign and Government is a sin that certainly condemneth all that live and die in it. 2. And that Actual continuance in gross sin is damning. As Mr.</hi> Shephard <hi>saith,</hi> sincere Convert, <hi>pag. 258. Though thy good Duties cannot save thee, yet thy bad Works will damn thee. And</hi> pag. 246. <hi>two things kee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a man from Christ. 1. Sin. 2. Self.</hi> And indeed the Lord Jesus saith expresly; <hi>These mine enemies that would not I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them before me,</hi> Luke 19. 27. <hi>And</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8, 9, 10. <hi>He that committeth sin is of the Devil; Whosoever is born of God sinneth not. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil; Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of God, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 5. 5, 6. <hi>Ye know that no Whoremonger, nor Ʋnclean person, nor Covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words; For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, Neither Fornicators, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21, 24. Rom. 8. 9, 13. All this is believed by our Divines, for they believe Gods word to be true.</p>
               <p>And is it not then undeniable, That 1. Accepting Christ to reign over us, 2. And sincerely obeying him, are conditions without which we cannot continue Justified, (nor be justified
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118986:182"/> without the first) nor be justified or saved at the last day? that which doth <hi>removere prohibens,</hi> remove impediments, can be no less then <hi>à causa sine qua non,</hi> if that impediment must be removed, and must by that means be removed. But this impediment (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing Christs Reign, and disobeying him in absolutely necessary things) must be removed, and that by the contraries: therefore accepting Christ to reign over us, and sincerely obeying him, can be no less then <hi>à causa sine qua non.</hi> And this being from the force of Divine Ordination in the Law of Grace, that subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are made so necessary a means to that end, and that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Disobedience is made so destructive, it must needs be that they have properly the nature of a condition: He that hath said, He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned: doth give us to understand▪ that it is the same believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whose presence hath the promise of Salvation, and whose ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hath the threatning of Damnation: Look what unbelief it is that is meant in the threatning, it is the contrary faith that is meant in the promise. But it is the not accepting Christ as King, that is part of the unbelief that condemneth: therefore it is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him as King that is the belief that saveth (supposing the other parts.) And lest any should say, saving and justifying is not all one (of which more anon) Christ doth say as much of justification it self. For justification is confessed to be opposed to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by those that I speak to: And Christ saith, <hi>Joh. 3. 18. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Not to be condemned, is beyond all doubt to be Absolved, or justified (and not a meer Negation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation as a stone hath:) Now it is here evident that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and condemnation are opposed as the effects or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: and believing and not believing are opposed as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Antecedents. Now it being <hi>a not believing</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, it is past doubt, that it is <hi>a not believing to Justification,</hi> or a Privation of the same faith that justifieth: Else were the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation so great, as to leave the words not intelligible: so that if we can but find out the nature of one branch, we may undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly know the other; Know but what is the condemning unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and you may easily know what is the justifying faith. Now the former is most expresly told us by the Judge himself, <hi>Luk</hi> 19. 27. beforecited. The sentence of Condemnation is past on them,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:118986:183"/> for not receiving Christ as King: <hi>These mine enemies that would not that I should Reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me, Joh. 1. 12. As many as received him,</hi> that is, believed, have power given them to be sons: And here as many as received him not as King, are condemned as enemies</p>
               <p>Nay, observe in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext in hand, that the reason why Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is the condemning sin, is because it is the privation of that faith which God hath made the condition of Justification and Salvation. And therefore it is said: <hi>But he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed.</hi> There is much more in this, <hi>because he hath not believed,</hi> then if it had been barely <hi>because he hath sinned, or is a sinner:</hi> though both may be true. For the Law of works condemneth every sinner, simply as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Law of Grace condemneth every unbeliever and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Rebel, that obstinately to the end refuseth recovering Grace: And it is the latter that this Text speaks of: Else it would have said, he is condemned already, because he is a sinner, or hath broke the Law of works. But some learned men tell me, to this, that unbelief is sin, and therefore there is no condemnation but by the Law of works▪ which condemneth for all sin? wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t need a New Law to condemn us for one sin or more, when the old condemneth for all? <hi>Answ.</hi> Though all unbelief be sin, yet all sin is not unbelief. And therefore we may well distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween sin, as sin in general, and as this sin in special which God hath, if final, excepted from pardon. The Law condemning all sin, prohibiteth not the Gospel, to adjoyn a special condemnation of one sin: Nor is it absurd that one duty should be doubly a duty by the common Precept of the Law, and a special Precept of the Gospel, nor that one sin should have a double Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, common as a sin by the Law of Works (though yet that will hold great dispute) and special, as the rejecting of the remedy by the Law of Grace. And it was not the prime intent of the Law of Grace, to condemn men for unbelief (which you say the Law doth▪) But to offer a remedy from former condemnation, the promise being the Principal part: but yet that this promise might not be slighted, it seemed good to the promiser to annex a threatning, that the refusal of the remedy might be doubly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And were it only the threatning of a non-liberation, non-remission, it were a true and proper penalty, when Liberation
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:118986:183"/> and Remission is given to all by a conditional Grant or Law of Grace. If the State or a King make an Act of free pardon, <hi>that all the Rebells in such a Countrie shall be pardoned that lay down Arms, and accept of pardon by such a day, and those that do not, shall die without mercy:</hi> Here you may say, they were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Law as Rebels: But yet they were not before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as refusers of pardon. 2. Or if they had, yet before their condemnation was not peremptory and remediless 3 Nor was a non-remission any part of their penalty. 4. Nor would it be unmeet by a new Act thus again to condemn them And it is one thing now for the Judge to hold an Assizes to try who were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and who not, and accordingly to condemn and justifie, and another thing to hold an Assizes to try which of these Rebels came in by the day, and accepted the pardon, and which not, and accordingly to condemn and justifie. To return therefore whence I am carried by this objection, it is evident by this Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. that as there is a common condemnation by the Law of works, of all sinners as sinners; so the Law of Grace dissolveth that, and absolveth all believing sinners, though sinners: but excepteth the want of faith, and so specially again condemneth by a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remediless condemnation all final impenitent unbelievers: not as sinners in general, but as such sinners in special: And that the reason of its condemnation is <hi>because they believed not,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is past doubt, that look what unbelief is the condemning unbelief, by this special Gospel condemnation, the contrary must needs be the justifying faith: But unwillingness that Christ should Reign over men, is the condemning unbelief: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>One other Argument let me take up from this text, whose next words expresly say the things we affirm. Ver. 19. <hi>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness rather then light, because their deeds were evil.</hi> Before we heard, that he that believeth is justified, or not condemned: and that he that believeth not (with that same faith) is condemned, and that <hi>eo nomine</hi> because he believeth not: And here it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said that this is the condemnation, that is, the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbelief, that Christ is come as a light, which is to Teach, and Guide, and Reform, <hi>and men loved darkness rather then this light, because their deeds were evil,</hi> which this light Discovered, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:118986:184"/> and would have Healed. May I not then by the warrant of this Text say on the contrary. [And this is the Justification, that is, the Justifying Faith, that Light is come into the world, and men love this Light better then darkness, that their deeds may be made manifest and healed of the evil.] Mark here also, that to love the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight is justifying Faith. Love to Christ in Accepting him as Redeemer, is Faith it self, and not to be excluded in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
               <p>To what is here said, adjoyn the Arguments which I have briefly given Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> to prove that to receive Christ as King and Prophet is justifying Faith.</p>
               <p>And as I have said this much in matter of Faith, so I might as fully have shewed that on their Concession, by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, Obedience must be a Condition of our continued and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Justification and Salvation.</p>
               <p>10. THe next Concession of our Divines that I shall mention, is this, they commonly teach, <hi>That sincere obedience is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of salvation;</hi> though some of them deny it to be a condition of justification. Now they say in this as much in sense as I do, &amp; on that ground I may well be warranted to say it is the Condition of our Justification at Judgement. For, 1. Justification at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Georg. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>xti, Epitom. Theolog</hi> pag. 264, 265.</note> is part of salvation in that stricter sense, as it is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used. 2. Justification at Judgement is the adjudging men to salvation: It is to try and Judge who are heirs of salvation and who not: And therefore undoubtedly the same thing that is the Condition of their salvation, is the Condition of their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you hold your Lands by a Deed of gift, the Judge will by the same Deed decide the Controversie for you, and pass Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on your side, when your Right is questioned. 3. Saving and Condemning are as frequently opposed in Scripture, or as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Justifying and Condemning. 4. Mans works are as strictly excluded by <hi>Paul</hi> from saving him, as from Justifying him (in that sense as he takes works in his exclusion) and saving is as strictly reserved as the effect of free Grace, as Justifying is: Nor is it any more dishonor to Christ that men Justifie themselves, then that they save themselves: Christ will have no partners in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:118986:184"/> his honour in either. See for this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24. compared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. and 4. 13. and 4. 16. and 5. 17, 18. and 6. 23. and 8. 1, 2, 6, 13, 14, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. throughout, <hi>Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. All which places fully shew that it was never the meaning of the Apostle to make Obedience a Condition of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and not of Justification at Judgement; or so to distinguish between these, as to exclude works from one, and not from the other▪ For so far as he excludeth them, he excludeth them from both. Only I still confess, that when Justification is taken for our first being Justified only, it must needs go before works of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience, but that is not <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning in excluding works, for he excludes them from saving as well as justifying. It must be acknowledged therefore, that in what sense they are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from saving, as Conditions, in that sense they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being Conditions of our Justification at Judgement, or as continued.</p>
               <p>A learned man here gives me a twofold answer, 1. That there is no proper Justification at judgement, but only a declaring that we are justified. <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. And another as learned Animadverter tels me, there is no other Justification but the Judges judicial Sentence. It is hard pleasing all Divines. 2. To declare by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive sentence is most properly to justifie, and more then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by a Narration. All Judicial Justification is but a declaring, by a deciding Sentence, who is just in Law. This is therefore as good an answer as to say, No Judge doth justifie: He doth but declare who was Justified before. But the Justification he had before, was of another sort, <hi>viz.</hi> Constitutive, and as to that of Sentence, but Virtual: The contrary therefore is a sound arguing: Every Judge that by Sentence declares who was just in Law, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by justifie them, that is, by Sentence. 3. I will believe God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. 1. God telleth us frequently, that we shall be judged, and that according to our Works: It is an Article of our Creed, that Christ will judge us. And Judging is the <hi>Genus</hi> which exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in its <hi>Species,</hi> which are well known to be Justifying or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, and Condemning▪ therefore to say, We are not justified then, is to say, either we are condemned, or not judged 2. Doth not Christ expresly say, <hi>Math. 12. 37 But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the day of judgement: For by thy words thou shalt be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:118986:185"/> and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</hi> It is a hard case among Christians and Divines, that these plain truths should meet with so much opposition.</p>
               <p>The second Objection is, that Obedience is indeed a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of salvation, but not of Right to salvation▪ (for they are forced to confess that to Justifie, is to give Right to Impunity, and so to salvation; and so it is all one thing: and therefore if works be the Condition of our Right to salvation, then also of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. I still confess that our first Right to salvation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore external works, (but not before Repenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce and Love to Christ.) But it is our adjudged▪ consummate, and continued Right, that the Question doth concern. And 1. hear our Teacher, <hi>Rev. 22. 14. Blessed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in by the Gate into the City.</hi> 2. It is a mistake of the very nature of a Condition, which causeth this Objection. The Condition is <hi>Promissionis vel Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti Conditio:</hi> The Condition of Gods Grant, or Christs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: And the Promise or Testament, is to convey Right, and not natural beings directly: and therefore the Condition is ever a Condition of the Right conveyed by the Promise. A natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Qualification, vulgarly called a natural Condition, may be said to be the Condition of the thing in its Physical being, (as the dryness of Wood and its proximity to the fire is of its burning.) But a Civil, Moral, Legal Condition, is ever a Condition of Right; it being Right that Laws and Promises do convey. He that cals for proof of this, will not much honour his understanding by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Especially in respect to our present case.</p>
               <p>11. ANother common Assertion, equipolent to what they blame in me, is this, <hi>That Faith Justifieth the Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and Works Iustifie the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in sence as much as I give to Works herein. For to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Faith of the person, is to justifie the person so far, when his Faith is questioned. If his Faith be not questioned (actually or virtually) and there be no use for Justifying it, then shall not his works Justifie it at all: If there be use for such a Justification
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:118986:185"/> of his Faith, (whether against an actual or implyed potential accusation) then himself is justified by the Justification of his Faith; that is, as to that Cause, and against the accusation. Nor is there any Justification of a mans cause, which Justifieth not the Man as to that cause: Nor any Justification of the man in Judgement, but by Justifying his cause▪ Only there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between cause and cause: between the question, Whether he be universally righteous? and Whether he be in this point and thus far righteous only? And I never affirmed that man is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther justified by his own Faith and Obedience, as the matter of his righteousness, at Gods bar, but only <hi>in tantum,</hi> as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cause. Yet I say, it is a Cause of great moment, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch our universal Justification hath a dependance on, as on a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When the question is, Whether we have performed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promise that gives right to Christ or not? as to this cause, our performance is the righteousness by which we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. And this is the Truth of God, which men maintain in other words, while they oppose it in these.</p>
               <p>12. ANother common Assertion is that [<hi>James</hi> by Works means a working Faith, when he saith we are Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Works, and not by Faith only▪] Thus Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> and the most of our Divines. I believe as well as they, that <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of Works as effects of Faith, qualifying it or proving it fit to justifie: but yet I believe verily that by Works he means Works indeed, having mentioned them no less then 12 times in 13 or 14 verses. But suppose the meaning be that a working faith Justifies, and not a faith that will not Work: If they place no reason of its justifying, in this modification (that it be working) the scope of <hi>Iam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s</hi> discourse confuteth them, and the reasons that he brings are made void and vain. It never was in his mind to take pains to prove the necessity of such a Qualification of Faith▪ as is no means, no not so much as a Condition, to the end in question, but is a meer concomitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>But if they mean, that Faiths working nature, is any means or Condition of its justifying, they say as much as I. For example; A man is promised his freedom if he pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. currant money. That it be money, is the substance of the Condition: but that it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:118986:186"/> be currant, is a modification of it, and part of the Condition; and<note place="margin">

So if God say, [He that believeth with a working Faith, shall be Justified] that it be working, is as necessary a part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as that it be Faith. And it is but the Conditionality that I assert.</p>

               <p>2.

               <p>14. IT is commonly asserted▪ [That Works are the <hi>Ratio Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae.</hi> the Reason of the Sentence of our Absolution] I know none that deny this.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:118986:186"/> Justification or pardon, nor of our right to the Kingdom; But it is the reason of the sentence, and so we may be said to be Justified because we are just, so far as we are just: The reason or cause of the sentence, and the thing sentenced being not the same. And as much do they generally say: Nay, it is as much as to say, we are properly justified by works in Judgement, and it is a fit and usual sense: For what more proper sense of the word <hi>Justifying,</hi> then this? when the thing is the very reason and cause of the sentence. And no doubt the reason why any man is judged just, is because he is just. And therefore his righteousness, so far as he hath it, is the reason of his Justification. And therefore when we must be Judged, whether we have performed the conditions of the pardoning Covenant, Our personal performance must be the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which must be the reason of our Justification</p>
               <p>And thus, (if partiality blind me not) I have shewed with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence to them that will see that I give no more to works in the points that I am blamed for, then the generality of Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants do give; Yea then many of themselves that contradict me: Only I attempted to explicate the nature and reason hereof, I thought, in a Method more plain and satisfactory: wherein if I came short of my ends, I hoped it might be pardoned as lost labor, rather then reproached as erroneous.</p>

                  <p>WHether good Works may be said to be necessary to Justification or Salvation? Some of our Divines affirm, and some deny it; disagreeing in form of words; but agreeing as to the sum of the matter. But that the Truth may be more evident, we will comprehend our Judgement in this matter, in these conclusions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. In our conflicts with the Papists about Justification, it is not meet or safe to use or admit these propositions: Good Works are necessary to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Or good Works are necessary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>For though they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a sound sense by using explications; yet when they are nakedly propounded, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists always mean that works are necessary as causes by their own true and proper worthiness Meritorious of mans Salvation: which is most false.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. In popular Sermons to the ignorant people, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said propositions are either wholly to be avoided, or to be used together with clear expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations—For perhaps they will think that this assertion hath this meaning, that it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth▪ that man is justified or saved by the vertue and merit of his good works.</p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:118986:189"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Good works are not to us necessary to Salvation, if by good works we understand works exactly good and perfect to the Rule of the Law.</p>
                  <p>I explain it: By works ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly good and perfect, I mean such as man not yet fallen could have performed, because the Decalogue may exact them even of fallen man under pain of eternal damnation. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection did consist especially in two things The first is, that man could perform good works with his whole heart, and with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love, no lust diminishing the due fervor of the heart, or aspersing any blot on these works. The latter is that the same man intire, could do good works in a perpetual and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted tenor, without any evil admixed or intervening. That these two are required to works legally good, is plain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, &amp;c. Works therefore le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally good, and necessary to Salvation by the legal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are those that flow from a pure and full love of God, and are used in a constant tenor to the very last breath, without the intermixture of any evil work in the mean time. I say that such good works are not at all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Justification or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Regenerate—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 4. No good works are
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:118986:189"/> to the Regenerate necessary to salvation or Justification, if by necessary, we mean, necessary under the reason of a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause.</p>
                  <p>Concl. 5. <hi>Bona quaedam opera sunt necessaria ad Justificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ut Conditiones concurrentes vel percursoriae, licet non sint ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria ut causae efficientes aut Meritoriae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these good Works, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon those internal ones which with God are of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the eyes of men; as to grieve for sin, to detest sin, humbly to subject ones self to God, to fly to Gods mercy, to fix our hope in Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to resolve upon a new life, and other such like. For Gods mercy justifieth not stocks, that is, such as do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nor horses and mules, that is, such as kick against it, and obstinately adhere to their lusts: but men, and those pricked and contrite, and such as follow the conduct of the Word and Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conclu.</hi> 6. God Works are necessary to the retaining and conserving the state of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Not as causes, which of themselves effect or merit this conservation: but as means or Conditions, without which God will not conserve the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:118986:190"/> grace of Iustification in men.</p>
                  <p>For as no man receiveth that general Iustification which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth from the guilt of all foregoing sins, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Repentance, Faith, a purpose of a new life, and other actions of the same kind; so no man retaineth a state free from guilt in respect of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins, but by means of the same actions of believing in God, calling on God, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flesh, daily repenting and sorrowing for sins daily committed. The reason why all these are required on our part, is this: Because these cannot be still absent, but their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites will be present, which are contrary to the nature of a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified man.—As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the conservation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life it is necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a man carefully avoid fire, water, precipices, poisons and other things destructive to the health of the body; so to the conserving of spiritual life, it is necessarily required that a man avoid Incredulity, Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and other things that are destructive and contrary to the salvation of souls; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided unless the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and contrary actions be exercised. And these actions do not conserve the life of Grace
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:118986:190"/> properly and of themselves, by touching the very effect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> conservation; but improperly and by accident, by excluding and removing the cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conclu.</hi> 7. The good Works of the Justified are necessary to salvation, by necessity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not of Causality: or more plainly, as the way ordinated to everlasting life, not as a meritorious cause of everlasting Life.</p>
                  <p>OF the name of merit, see what I cited before: to which add cap. 54. p. 571, 572.</p>
                  <p>We come now to explain the Opinion of our Divines: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in observe especially this thing: Though our Divines do now abstain from the word merit, which the Fathers frequently use, yet they do it, not that they dissent from the Fathers, but lest they consent with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who against all antiquity, do violently draw that word to a pernicious and heretical sense. For that which the Fathers meant by the word Merit, to wit, the work of a Believer and regenerate per on, indued with a supernatural goodness, in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Order, grateful and acceptable to God, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:118986:191"/> by the Promise of the most bountiful God, to the gratious Rewards of this life and that to come, All this our Divines have alwayes granted. We do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fight against, not the bare name of Merit, in a harmless sense frequently used of old by the Fathers, but the proud and false opinion of Merit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, brought lately by the Papists into the Church of God. See <hi>Bucer in Colloq. Ratis.</hi> p. 565. <hi>Chemnit. Exam. Conc. Trid. in 4 qu.</hi> of good Works, p. 185. <hi>Calvin. Institut.</hi> l. 3. c. 17. Sect. 3.</p>
                  <p>WEE ever granted that an endeavour of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and study of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are necessary to salvation, as an Antecedent Condition: but the act of mortification as it is said to be ours, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as a cause properly so called, but as a <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> or removing that which prohibits, to which the reason of causality is but improperly given. For such causes do not reach or cause the effect it self, but only some thing previous or connexed with the effect.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:118986:191"/>
                  <p>IN like manner, because God hath Promised the Reward Eternal to the poor Works of Believers; when the last Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes, he will say, <hi>Come, inherit the Kingdom; for I was hungry,</hi> &amp;c. But he is stark mad with pride who will hence infer with the Jesuites, that a bit of bread, or draught of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to Christs poor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is the efficient cause or truly meritorious of such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite glory. We say therefore, that Good Works are <hi>Motives</hi> to which God hath respect in giving the heavenly Reward, because of his own Ordination and Promise; but not that they are the efficient causes of this Reward, by their own dignity and efficacy.</p>
                  <p>THe Works of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate have an Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Rewards of this life and that to come. 1. Because God hath freely promised (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleasure of his will) the Rewards of this life and that to come, to the good Works of the faithful and regenerate, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:118986:192"/> to be Ordinated to the divine Rewards, from the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Worker.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have an Ordination to the Rewards from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the works themselves.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>DAre any Arminian affirm that Remission of sin is effected by Faith? (or is the effect of Faith) although that Remission befall none but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. You will say, Faith is at least somewhat prerequisite for the obtaining Remission of sin. Let it be so: and for that reason let it be called an effect of Faith: But only in the kind (or nature) of a Dispositive Cause.</p>
                  <p>BEyond Controversie, Good Works are a Dispositive cause of salvation.</p>
                  <p>And that Faith is a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of salvation, doth nothing hinder but that it may bea means also to obtain salvation. Yea every Condition of this kind hath the nature of a means: and every moral means hath the nature of a Condition in respect of the end. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the due means the end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained: And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a Condition hath
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:118986:192"/> the nature of a means to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that which is under a condition propounded to us to be obtained.]</p>
                  <p>[Yea, I say, that faith is on no other account, a means, then because God hath appointed to save men by faith, and to save none at age without faith. For such kind of means is no means but by Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>THe Ordination of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be absolute, though the bestowing of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not absolute, but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not only of the impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by blood on Christs part, but also of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance on our part.]</p>
                  <p>[To the attaining of which end, there was necessary as the impetration of Salvation made by blood on Christs part, so faith and Repentance on our part: and that is because God hath appointed to bestow Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on us by way of reward.]</p>

                  <p>FRom this Witness I conclude. 1. That he abhorred to call faith an efficient cause of justification: Therefore it is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Efficient in his opinion. 2. That faith is the cause of Justification and works of Salvation, which is more then I say. 3. That faith and works are causes of one and the same kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Dispositive: (which I take to be no proper cause) 4. That Faith, Repentance and Works are the conditions of Salvation. 5. That the reason why faith and other duties are means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is because God hath freely appointed them to be the conditions and means thereof, and so not formally <hi>vel proximè</hi> from the receptive nature, or instrumentality of faith. 6. That it is as a condition of Contract or Covenant that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are means of Salvation, and therefore it is of right to Salvation that they are conditions, seeing it is right which the Covenant gives. 7. And though he say that Justification is only by faith without works, yet he speaks plainly of our being put into a justified State: and so I say so as much as he. But if right to Salvation be on condition of obedience, then doubtless Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at Judgement will pass on that condition. To be Justified, will be to have our right to Impunity and Salvation cleared and determined. 8. That we must needs seek Salvation by good works. 9. That the blood of Christ and the works of man are by him both made conditions of Salvation. 10. That Salvation is the Reward both of faith and good works. 11. That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is not absolute, any more then the Covenant of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:118986:194"/> Works: but as to that of the same nature. 12. That it was Gods design in the Covenant of Grace, not only to glorifie the riches of Grace, but also to glorifie his <hi>Rewarding Justice,</hi> and that it is great pitty that this is not usually considered as being a matter of great moment.

                  <p>The matter is not artificially enough explained when you say, [though the whole matter depend upon many, yet the confession of sins is a second cause of Remission.] These things are perplexed. This were righter, that mercy alone is the proper and immediate efficient cause of Remission; But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is either some Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> as I (use to) speak: But a second cause no man so cals it.]</p>
                  <p>Concerning this matter, when I lately look't into the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for in the beginning of 4. <hi>Sent. 1. Q.</hi> they dispute of this Appellation) I wondered at the Judgement of some of them, who thought that Merit is only a <hi>causa sine qua non:</hi>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:118986:194"/> These seem to me to speak very modestly.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Cordatus</hi> stirreth up against me the City, and also the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor Countries, and also the Court it self, because in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the controversie of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I said, that new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You know in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and how distinctly I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to handle these things.]</p>
                  <p>The title of repentance is more commodious then of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (<hi>viz.</hi> to commend works without offence) For I have oft observed that our men do with more equal minds hear the praises of works, when we treat of Repentance, then when they think we treat of Justification: When these two places are meerly neighbors, or of kin.</p>
                  <p>VVHerefore faith may be called righteousness, because it is that thing which is imputed to righteousness, (that we may speak with <hi>Paul</hi>) in what part of man soever it be placed: For that nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth Gods imputation.</p>

                  <p>THat which I conclude hence, as <hi>Melancthons</hi> opinion, is, 1.

                  <p>HEnce I conclude, 1. That God imputeth faith for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, according to <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement (concerning which I have spoke my own before) 2. That he saith that God taketh our works to be Righteousness, or imputeth them for Righteousness. 3. That he taketh it to be all one▪ to Judge works Righteous, and to impute them for or to righteousness. And therefore they that confess them to be an inherent righteousness, must confess them to be so imputed. 5. Let them consider what follows hence, that confess justification and imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to be all one: Whether it will not be as excusable or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to say, that we are (so far) justified by those works, as to say that they are imputed to us to or for righteousness? as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> here doth. 6. He doth in these and in the other passages of [Provoking Gods mercy to us] [Acquiring Gods favor] [Their answering for us before God] say more in terms (and more harshly) and as much in sense, for the exalting of works, as ever I did, if I understand him.</p>

                  <p>IN these few words are closely couched these ten points, which I maintain. 1. That it is not as any part our righteousness of the Law of works, that faith justifieth. 2. Nor from any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the act or habit, as the nearest reason of its interest in justification. 3. That Christs righteousness is the matter or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cause of our righteousness. 4. Faith is the acceptance of Christ as offered, and righteousness with him. 5. That the Gospel-Covenant is Gods deed of gift, bestowing right to Christ, and righteousness with him. 6. That therefore constitutive Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is performed by the Gospel-Covenant as the Instrument. 7. That Christ himself is first given by this Covenant, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness but in him. 8. That the nearest or formal reason of faiths interest in Justification, is, its being the condition of the justifying Covenant, freely by the Donor and Rector, Assigned to that Office. 9. That the reason why faith was deputed to this office by God, (so far as man may give a reason of his actions) was from the special aptitude it had to this special work, it being essentially the acceptance of Christ and life freely given. So that this is but its aptitude to the Office, and the reason of its designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto, and not the nearest or formal reason of its interest. 10. That this condition comes in the place of perfect obedience, which was the condition of the first Covenant: but not from the same reasons, nor to the same nearest ends.</p>
                  <p>But the special point that I cite this Author for, is his exact discovery how far works justifie, and of the twofold righteousness thereto necessary, and the reconciling <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> as in part the words following shew.</p>

                  <p>THis will perhaps be more fitly thus explained. Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is opposed to accusation. And at Gods Bar we are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a twofold Accusation: First it is objected, that we are sinners: that is, guilty of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the condition which was imposed in the Legal Covenant.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:118986:197"/> Next it is objected, that we are Unbelievers, that is, that we did not perform the condition of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith. From the former Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, we are Justified by faith only, whereby we embrace Christs Grace and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. From the latter, we are justified also by works, as faith is shewed by them; <hi>James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the latter accusation, did justly affirm that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. But <hi>Paul</hi> respecting the former, saith that a man is Justified by faith without works, &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>In the day of Judgement, because the Covenant of Grace shall obtain the force of a Law or Rule of Judgement (for it hath been promulgated by fit Heralds in the whole world) This one thing will be to be proved, to wit, that we had the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that is, faith. Therefore works must be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced, especially of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the effects and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments demonstrative, as they commonly say, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> of that condition, that is, of faith.</p>

                  <p>IN these words is the sum of most that I am blamed for. Here is the twofold righteousness opposite to a twofold accusation, that is, of non-performance of the conditions of each Covenant: one accusation true, which Christs satisfaction only can justifie us against as the matter, and faith is but the condition of that Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: the other is a false accusation, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, from which faith must Justifie us as the very matter of our righteousness, and works as proofs. To which may be added, that Repentance and Obedience being secondary parts of the condition of Salvation, on the same ground as we may need a Justification against the charge of final unbelief, we may also need one against the charge of final impenitency and disobedience; and therefore by these materially must be justified against that charge. We see here also that the Judgement is not appointed to enquire whether Christ have satisfied for us, but whether we have performed the condition of the New Covenant: and therefore he saith this is the one thing then to be proved: And that the New Covenant will be the Law by which we must be herein Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I desire the Reader to peruse all the rest of that excellent disputation; I will transcribe but a few lines more to shew that the continuance of Justification is in the first gift of it intimated to be on condition we afterward live holily.</p>

                  <p>A Sinner is considered either absolutely and in himself only; In that sense none shall be Justified by the works of the Law in Gods Judgement, &amp;c. Or comparatively with another sinner; &amp; in this sense some shall in Gods judgement be Justified by works before others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then this is to be diligently and attentively noted: that God is nowhere said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to render in Judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Works of the Law; But only according to Works: For the word [Works] doth sometime and most frequently belong to legal righteousness, which must be most perfect, that it may Justifie <note n="*" place="margin">

Sometime it signifieth all mans obedience, even that which is performed to the precept of believing in the mercifull God, and of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In which sense faith it self and repentance are contained under this kind. In this sense, and not in the former are all those places to be understood, in which it is said that God will render to every man according to his works. For God will render to every man according

For since God hath made with man the Covenant of Grace, he will afterwards Judge no man absolutely and simply by the Law, but by the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the New Covenant which tempereth the rigor of the Law. And this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of very great use, and diligently to be observed in the right dividing of the word; For when we have to do with a sinner that trembleth under the yoke of the Law, laboreth under the weight of sin, then Justification by faith in the blood of Christ is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him for his consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But when we deal with one Carnally secure, and sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in sin, then must we urge the Judgement of God which in that great day shall proceed according to Works, for the excitation of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

And not only so, but that the members may be conform to the head, there floweth from him into us the spirit of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which in us ourselves also may fulfill the Justification of the Law. He so Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us that in our minds we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God. And the sin that is left in our flesh, he so abolisheth by degrees, that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:118986:200"/> at last we shall be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any spot or blemish by the Law itself. All this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness therefore, both impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which we have by faith in Christ our head, and inherent which we have by Regeneration in our selves, is indeed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law; But neither of them from the Law, or by the Law: but both of them, from the blood and spirit of Christ. And the first is that which is mentioned <hi>Rom. 4. 11. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. whereby God Justifieth us▪ even by the Testimony of the Law, and that fully, though in our selves we are inconform to the Law, and he accounteth us as altogether conform in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 4. 24. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 7. whereby God doth partly now justifie us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ownselves conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in part to the Law; and daily justifieth us more and more, as our Regeneration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth; and will fully Justifie us when perfection is come. Of which Justification is spoken <hi>Jam. 2. 21, 24. Rev. 22. 11. Mat. 1. 2▪ 37. 1 King.</hi> 8. 32. The works of the Law do enter this Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Yea they only do constitute it: As faith alone
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:118986:201"/> doth constitute the first, that is, Christs righteousness by faith imputed, not works: So works and not faith do constitute the latter. Yet is it not therefore of (or from) the Law, but from Grace. For the Law doth not admit it by the Authority of its own power, which can praise nothing but what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy; but by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Grace of Christ, whereto the Law is now a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and by whose command the Law commendeth, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and taketh as conformable to itself even the imperfect works of believers; which Grace we do embrace by faith, and by that faith are made prompt and chearful to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor the righteousness of the Law: yet is it not properly faith, but works that constitute that second righteousness.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a twofold Justification. One whereby, in ourselves being sinners, we are Justified before God, from without us: The other whereby being now Justified before God from without us, we are justified before him within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The first of these is the cause of the second. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the effect and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the first. The first is done by faith, the other by works. Both must concur that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:118986:201"/> the righteousness of the Law may be fulfilled in us. But you'l say, is there not then a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Law, if it be of the works of the Law? I say, No: Because the works which we speak of, though they are of the Law, as to the Rule which they follow, and as prescribed by the Law; Yet in respect of the Original and power whence they come, they are not of the Law, but of Grace and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Specially because they are said to be Justified by the Law, who are justified by works, as by the condition of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fulfilled, which is then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done when works do by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal perfection answer the Law. For then the Law Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a man, as a man doth his wife that never violated her faith to him. For as it is from conjugal right that this Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the wife proceeds; so from the like right, which God hath constituted in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, between his Law and man, proceeds the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that man, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate kept his fidelity to the Law, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Let us speak fullier of the second sort of justification. It is that whereby God, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation given us, and the works of sincere faith which we performed, absolveth us from
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:118986:202"/> the charge of Hypocrisie, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness and impiety, and no longer takes us for men dead in sin, servants of the Devil, and children of the world, but for true believers, his sons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>stored to his image, endued with his life, and translated into his Kingdom: which Iudgement of God, the Law also appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. Not that it takes it self satisfied by our works; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being bereaved of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and subjected to Christ our Lord, it cannot choose but commend the works which come from faith in Christ and from his spirit, &amp; account them for true righteousness, though they are imperfect; and them that perform them, for truly righteous, and sons pleasing to God. Let it be here enquired, seeing Scripture doth often and expresly ascribe to us both these righteousness we speak of, and therefore we are in respect of them both to be judged righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not only with men, but with God; Whether in the same sense, as we are said to be Justified by works, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. and to be justified by words, <hi>Mat. 12. Works may not be said to be imputed to us for Righteousness?</hi> Not indeed as faith is imputed to righteousness: but as the fact of <hi>Phineas</hi> is said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for righteousness,</p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:118986:202"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 31. For it is our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to righteousness, by which the obedience which Christ performed for us, is taken as ours, and thereby we unjust and sinners are absolved from the revenge of an angry God; there faith alone embracing that obedience, is imputed to righteousness. And it is another imputation of righteousness, when the works of piety, that come from our selves, Justified by faith, and regenerate by the Holy Ghost, though imperfect and deservedly to be blamed and rejected, are yet taken of God by grace through Christ, as good, holy and just, and thence we are absolved from the charge of wickedness and guile, and, compared with the wicked and profane, are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as honest. Here even works are imputed to righteousness. Hence arise these differences; That faiths imputation is to perfect righteousness, such as is the obedience of Christ; The imputation of works to imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, such as are works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this life. In one the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Law is satisfied; In the other the Law being made the instrument of grace doth condescend and accommodate it self to us, that imputation is the cause of the Remission of sins: This not so, as having no
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:118986:203"/> place till sins are remitted. In that a sinner is absolved from guilt: in this the Godly is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the ungodly.—Here the person is considered as a Godly man, whom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving among the ungodly, and being with others to appear before the Tribunal of God, he pronounceth, and will pronounce by his works of Godliness an heir of his Kingdom <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 34, 35. In the one God passeth Judgement of the price of his sons blood, how much it availeth us, with him. In the other, he passeth sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the gift of Regeneration bestowed on us; that is, how he esteemeth us because of it.—</p>
                  <p>The first consisteth in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin by Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence imputed. The other in that Judgement of God, whereby (overlooking through Christ the defect of our works) he esteemeth them righteous, and conform to his Law, and from thence pronounceth us piously righteous: According to the saying 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 7. He that doth righteousness is righteous.

                     </gap>eous Law; But by force of Christs imputed righteousness, from which it flows, and on whose grace it wholly resteth.—The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. that neither the unrighteous, nor Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:118986:203"/> abusers of themselves with mankind, nor Thieves, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, nor Drunkards, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God: It is therefore necessary for Christians to be Justified from these crimes, if they will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And this the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth was done; [For (saith he) such were some of you, but ye are washed, (that is, clensed of these pollutions) but ye are Sanctified (that is, separated from this uncleanness;) but ye are justified (that is, ye are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted guiltless) that ye may no more be accused as guilty of those crimes: and that in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this of the second Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were under these crimes, being now regenerated in the name of Christ, and by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, could no longer be accused of them, but ought to be absolved thence. This is the same thing that the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. He that is dead, is Justified from sin; that is, is so freed from it, that he can no longer be accused as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of sin, as being now to be accounted a hater of sin, and not a friend of it. Where further note, that the first Justification is from sins that we are guilty
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:118986:204"/> of: But the second, from such as we are not guilty of. When a man hath committed sin, he is guilty, nor is he Justified from it, that is, he is not absolved from the guilt of it, but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, which is, by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But take a Regenerate man, who before Regeneration was a Drunkard, a Fornicator, &amp;c. but since his regeneration hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over these sins; This man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he hath ceased, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accused of these sins, as before. Therefore he is Justified from them, that is, absolved from what he committed not; And this justification is truly by works. For because he lived so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and chastly, he ought to be altogether justified from Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness and Fornication—To this second sort of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation appertaineth that which in Schools is wont to be called A Iustification of the Cause; as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iacobs</hi> case, &amp;c.—In the same manner stands the case with all the faithfull. For seeing the Devil is said to be the Accuser of the brethren, accusing them day and night before God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. and not with God only, but also in our own Consciences, wh<seg rend="sup">ich</seg> he hurteth with a suspition of hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>risie, and often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it, as if we professed faith and godliness with a less sincere, yea
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:118986:204"/> dissembling mind, we have need therefore to be absolved from this accusation, and justified from this false witness, before God, which is another matter then to be Absolved and justified from the guilt of all our sins by which we are bound to the wrath and just judgement of God. This is the work of the first Iustification, and is done only by Faith in Christ: The other is the work of the second Iustification, and fetcheth help from our Works.</p>
                  <p>[YOU see then that by works a man is justified and not by Faith only, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 24.] It is easie to reconcile<note place="margin">In all this is as much for Works as I: and much worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving: but I conceive with some want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

Seeing there is a double Accusation made against Believers: one by God, the Law and conscience, by whom they ate truly charged with the guilt of many crimes: the other by the Devil and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, by whom they are falsly charged as guilty of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, a mercenary minde, ungodliness, &amp; wickedness; there is therefore required a double Iustification: One by which men in themselves truly sinners, are Absolved freely through Christ, from the guilt of their sins; which Iustification is by</p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:118986:205"/>
                  <p>Faith alone without Works: The other by which they are Absolved from those false charges of the Devil and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, as being truly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and Regenerate: which Iustification is fetcht from Works. <hi>James</hi> urgeth that both must be conjoyned, and so that a man is not justified by Faith only, but by works also: that is, that it is not enough to be justified by Faith from the sins which one hath committed; but it is requisite also to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Works from the sins which he is falsly accused of, and from which through Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration he is free.</p>

                  <p>TO be Justified by Faith,<note place="margin">Bucerus.</note> which is the first Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and of Life, <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth by [to be called the friend of God] that is, sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgiven, to be reconciled with God, and be received by him into favour and friendship, when a man was before an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God, and child of wrath. But to be Justified by Works, he teacheth is the same, as to receive of God for good Works, that which <hi>Abhaham</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> received of him, that is, Approbation, Praise and Reward.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 318. he saith, [We Judge that this inchoate righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is indeed a true and lively righteousness, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and eminent gift of God, and that our new life in Christ consisteth of this righteousness, and that all the Saints also are righteous by this very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, both before God and before men; and that for it also the Saints are Justified by the Justification of Works, that is, they are approved of God, Praised and Rewarded. Yet though this righteousness be true and lively, and justifie in its manner, it is not such, or so
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:118986:206"/> true, lively or solid, as that any Saint can by it be justified with the Iustification of life, much less that it self should be the Righteousness or Iustification of life.</p>
                  <p>This only is controverted in the question of the Reward of good Works, Whether there be in the good Works of the Regenerate any merit condign of the Reward which God renders to them? For that life eternal is given to the faithful doing good Works, and that in place of a Crown and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we alway granted.]</p>
                  <p>HEre it may be questioned, Whether we do reconcile, or procure to our selves the love of God by our Godlyness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How agrees it with that of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 10. In this is love, not that we loved him, but, <hi>&amp;c. Answ.</hi> As to the first procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods love, it is not done by our Godlyness, but contrarily our Godlyness flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it: For those whom God by his free love hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to himself by Christ, them he also sanctifieth by his Spirit. And of this Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do the alledged places speak. But as to the <hi>Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:118986:206"/> and <hi>Increase</hi> of the love of God, once reconciled (or set upon us) this verily is effected by our Godlyness, whose root is a true Faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>AND indeed good Works in respect of Eternal life, have the nature of an efficient Cause: Not as Merits, but as the way or walking by which we come to eternal life, by Gods Ordination. The matter may be declared by this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; As if a Treasure which is hid in the top of a mountain be given to one, but <hi>on this Condition,</hi> that if he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, he must climbe the Hill, and dig it up: Here doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less climbing the hill and digging up the treasure hath the nature of an efficient Cause, in respect of the possessing and enjoying of the treasure; but it hath not the nature of Merit; for the Treasure was freely given him.</p>

                  <p>[As the rest of the actions signified by faith as it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially and Synedochically, are not ordinated of themselves, and directly, properly to effect the friendship of God, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but to the not-losing of faith, to which they are many ways profitable: Or at least to the <hi>Not-losing</hi> the friendship of God or Salvation: So neither will they Justifie and save pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and directly. They avail us as by them we exclude and beware sins and ingratitude, which would be the true cause altogether of our losing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Salvation: Such a cause we call a remover of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and are wont to refer it to a cause by accident.]</p>
                  <p>[1. Faith is obedience, as its proper act doth answer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Gospel, Believe in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:118986:211"/> the Lord Jesus: And so faith is obedience to the Gospel, saith the Apologie of the <hi>August. Confession, pag.</hi> 125. As far as the Law differeth from the Gospel, so far doth this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence differ from that, saith <hi>Mentz,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>2. Also faith is obedience as by a Metonymical Synecdoche it signifieth the whole worship performed by believers; the root with the fruits: <hi>Heb. 13. 7. Rom. 1. 8. 1 Thes.</hi> 1. 8. [Nor is there any doubt when it is said, this is the Commandment that we believe and love, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. As in the precept of Loving▪ both the Habit of Charity and the fruits and works to which the Habit is ordinated, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; so also in the precept of believing, both the habit of faith and the fruits thereof are commanded to us] Whence it is that Charity it self being among the fruits of faith, the whole Christian doctrine is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Word or preaching of faith;</hi> the whole oeconomy of the New Testament, is called <hi>Faith, Gal. 1. 23. 1 Tim. 4. 6. Gal.</hi> 6. 5 &amp; 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Luther</hi> often understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith, chiefly indeed and formally the Apprehension of the promise in Christ, and the denyal of our own merit, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth withal our whole Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:118986:212"/> and Inclination of the will, and Charity so agreeable to the Gospel: And by <hi>Works</hi> contrarily he understandeth, Actions done with an Opinion of merit, and with an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iustification and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as wages of Debt.</p>
                  <p>By this it is easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Question of Faith alone justifying: When it is said <hi>without the works of the Law,</hi> there are excluded, 1. Works done in the Truth of Legal obedience, and so of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by Innocency, and as to whom the Reward is due with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Remission of sin and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation according to Grace, &amp;c. 2. And works done with an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of true Legal obedience and merit by Innocency. 3. And works done with an Opinion of merit without Legal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Innocency; or by any imperfect or particular obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereto the Reward is any way given without imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to Grace, by a promise on Condition of works. Except (or beside) <hi>Accepting</hi> and <hi>Retaining.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Papists therefore do greivously err, in that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Works commonly taken with Merits: and as soon as they
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:118986:212"/> hear a pious work commanded, they presently understand it of Merit, and of Work Legally so called. So when they hear of Reward promised, they again understand it juridically and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, as in some Contract of Location and Condition; when indeed any thing is usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Reward, which we obtain by precedent labour, and by any troubles, the fear of which might have excluded us from the proposed Good, and which are recompensed with the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the benefit following. And such are, not only 1. The rendering of that good whereto the precedent work doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by condign goodness (to wit, Merit of Condignity) but also 2. The performing of a Gift of freest Alms, which the poor that expecteth it in humble and faithful perseverance, shall not make void by contempt and ingratitude. Such Acceptance is not the Cause efficient and meriting the donation already past; but it is a Condition of not losing the Gift, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Cause meriting and certainly effecting our loss of it. Nor doth it effect any thing of it self, by its own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Dignity, but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting liberality and mercy of the giver, or of one interceding with the giver. 3. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:118986:213"/> of a promise which is made on Condition, not only of Accepting thankfully and not contemning the Gift, (for no Gift is so free and pure but it includeth this Condition,) but also of a Certain work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Acceptance and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, otherwise necessary, which therefore is in some sort meritorious, though perhaps between the work and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Reward there is no equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and commutation, as one being given for the other. As if a Father promise a Jewel to his child for taking a bitter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, or a Prince a Reward to a Subject in an exercise and fight that is profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, &amp;c. here the Gift is not meerly gratuitous and pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing begins not to be Due as soon as the promise and donation is accepted, but when the condition is fulfilled: nor is it properly merit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, seeing the worker doth rather profit himself, then give that to another for which he should receive an equal price; so that here also it effecteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing properly by its own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and dignity, but by the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Magnificence, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Giver, or of one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding with the Donor; But it is a certain Merit, improperly so called, which they call <hi>ex
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:118986:213"/> pacto,</hi> of Contract. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion admitteth such a thing in respect of good works in Gods children, to whō God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised rewards. Though others do not undeservedly wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the word Merit, because of its ambiguity, and great abuse. There is another Merit which they call of congruity: But it either seemeth not to signifie any Merit at all, or to involve a Contradiction.] See the rest.</p>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:118986:214"/> thankfulness, which of its own nature is wont to be required in every gift how free soever. And such obedience as this is peculiarly called Works by the Apostle, and Merit proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Latines. And they that obey on this condition, are called workers, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 4. and 11. 6. And if this proposition be thus expounded, those works which cannot consist with faith, that is, which are done with a Confidence and Opinion of Merit, are wholly excluded, so that they are not only denied to Justifie, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>[Such are (works obtaining the reward) not only by merit of condignity, but also, 1. The execution of a Donation or an almes meerly free, which the poor expecting in humble and faithfull perseverance, doth not make void by contempt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
                  <p>2. The execution of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which is not only made on condition of accepting and not contemning the gift (which condition there is no gift so free but it doth include,) but also of a certain work besides, which therefore is after a sort Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; though between this work and the prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:118986:214"/> and nothing in Commutation: as if a father promise a child a Jewell to take a bitter Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: And this is neither a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation meerly free, because the thing begins not to be due as soon as the promise is accepted, but when the condition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: Nor properly is it Merit of condignity, seeing the worker rather profits himself then gives that to another for which he should receive an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual price: But is a certain Merit improperly so called, which they call of Contract, (or promise.) Such a thing we admit in respect of good works in sons, to whom God hath promised the reward.]</p>

For Christ did not satisfie for all that we were bound by the Law to do (for then he should have come into the world to destroy the Law;) but only for so much (or those things) which either we had done against the Law, or had not done, when we ought to have done them.]</p>

The Covenant of the Law stood in these terms, He that doth these things shall live thereby: so that the condition was righteousness according to the exact Rule of the Law.

Do this, saith the Law: Believe in Christ, saith the Gospel. So that when the question is of Reconciliation and the parts thereof, or either of them, whether it be by faith or no? The meaning is this, Whether believing be the condition which we are to perform, that we may be reconciled to God, or no?

                  <p>So pag. 21. [The walking in the Light, as he is in the Light, is that Qualification whereby we become immediately capable of Christs righteousness, or actual participants of his propitiation; which is the sole immediate cause of our Justification, taken for Remission of sins, or actual approbation with God.</p>

                  <p>IN the first of these sayings, Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> gives as much, and the very same place to Works of Obedience as I do: though he give more to Faith (at least in words;) and by that means puts a greater difference between them. Yet I confess them to differ in the nature of the acts as much as he doth▪ Faith being the Recipient Conditional act, and Obedience not Recipient: And in the Office I maintain that Faith hath so far the precedency, that not only without the Causality, or Conditionality, but also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the presence of Works of outward Obedience, it is sufficient (as the Condition) to our being put into a Justified state. 2. And therefore Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in his second passage saith more then I do for walking in the Light: though I believe, he meant no more. 3. And in the third passage he saith the same as I: For he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that Works are Passive in their own nature: that were an absurdity and plain contradiction: but that as to the effect of Justification they are no causes, but Passive qualifications of the subject, making it morally capable thereof. And he puts both Works, and A purpose to walk with God, because A purpose and Covenant to obey (which is heart-subjection) is enough to our being first Justified; but it must be actual Obedience that must concurr to the continuance of that state, and to our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Absolution, as Mr. <hi>Balls</hi> first passage expresly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

There is great difference between these Conditions; one is simple, not Conditionate, and (as they say) simply given, without respect to another dignity, (or worthiness:) But the other is Conditionate, and given <hi>secundum quid,</hi> that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all its authority and certainty from the former: to wit, Repentance and Faith in Christ.

And the latter is an Instrumental cause, or organ of acceptance applying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:118986:223"/> and mercy obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That respecteth Justice: this mercy, by that satisfaction is given to the just Judge▪ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hurt or imminution of his Justice, as himself proclaims from heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. and 17. 5. in whom I am well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in whom I am appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rest satisfied. But by that other, to wit, Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, man satisfieth himself in his own conscience, that he may consist without any offence from the Justice of God. As therefore it is a hainous errour of them, who confound these conditions in the business of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, so peculiarly doth <hi>Socinus</hi> err, and break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blasphemy, while turning his eye to this Condition, to wit, Faith and Repentance, which is the less principal, and resting on this alone, he affirmeth it to be the efficient and meritorious cause of obtaining mercy. But the other more principal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which this would be as a body without a soul, or a shell without a kernel, he blindly passeth over, and neglecteth, as if he saw it not. For if only bare Faith in Christ and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance would suffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gods mercy; of what use, I pray you, was that former Condition premised to this? to wit, the Promise and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:118986:224"/> of the holy one, and of his death and sacrifice, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press injunction, that mens eyes and Faith be directed to this Holy seed. <hi>Socinus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth violence to God, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning what he hath conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that which God would have put first, he doth not so much as let it follow after, but endeavoureth wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and blot it out of the memory of men.]</p>

                     <hi>Et lib. 15. cap. 4. Sect. 27, 28. pag.</hi> 518. [Conditions in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or Covenant, we observe are of two kinds, which I think good to distinguish by names, though perhaps less proper <note n="*" place="margin">That is true.</note>;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:118986:224"/> some are Precedent, others Consequent. I call those Precedent, which cause the Contract, <hi>ex formula, do ut des;</hi> As when a man selleth Land for a certain summe of money. So in contracting matrimony, there is a mutual Donation of Bodies. Such Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these do not only by the defect of them destroy (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scind) the contract, but also do constitute (or lay) the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and as I may say, the essence. But the Consequent are added to the Precedent as depending on them. They are truly mutual between both parties: but they oblige but one party on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so that because of them the other is bound to do no more (or is no further obliged) As if one▪ upon the giving or selling of Land, do impose an annual Pension of money to be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the poor. So daily in contracting marriages, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Dowry is added. Now such kind of Conditions as these are wont to make void the contract by their absence▪ but yet not to effect the contract; yea unless the sale were already full and perfect, there would be no yearly Pension (or Payment) of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: And before this can be, it is requisite that the buyer have not only the right of Propriety, but also that he have taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Land, that is, that the seller have performed his part.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Law of Works exacteth the fulfilling of the Law, as the Antecedent Condition, without which, not only cannot man have possession of life eternal, but not so much as Right to life eternal. But in this sense of a <hi>Condition,</hi> the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> admitteth not Works: but only <hi>in the other:</hi> that is, that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the life already given because of Faith▪ Works should be necessary▪ so that he that performeth (or exhibiteth) no Works, should lose (or fall from) all that Right which he had, or seemed to have, by external Vocation: though otherwise Works are not the cause of giving life.</p>
                  <p>I Can scarce express my own thoughts more clearly then <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> here doth, as to the sense▪ His Antecedent Conditions are those that are necessary to the very being of the Contract, or Reception of Right and Possession. His Consequent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are such as are to be performed after Contract, Propriety and Possession; but yet such, as if they are not performed,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:118986:225"/> the party forfeits all his Right, and disobligeth the other party. Of the former sort is Faith; Of the latter is sincere obedience; As the example of <hi>Chamier</hi> illustrateth it: (For I will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one to the contract for house or Land, and the other to the rent or homage, lest men find words to feed their contentious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.) Or suppose a Prince give a Traytor a Pardon on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he thankfully accept it, and also once a year come to him, and say, I thank you, and turn not Rebel again; (though he may possibly commit lesser offences) in this case all is free: yet Conditional. Thankful acceptance is the Condition of the first Right: Annual acknowledgment and non-Rebelling of the continuance: Just so (as neer as I can conceive) it is in our case: Faith with Repentance being the Conditions of our first Right and Possession: After Obedience and Gratiude (with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the said Faith and Repentance) being Conditions of the continuance or not losing our Iustification.</p>
                  <p>Only here observe in <hi>Chamiers</hi> words, 1. That though the sense be very sound, yet the term of Consequent Conditions is less convenient; because it is taken from its respect to the first Right, and not to the form with its own proper effect: <hi>i. e.</hi> It is by him called a Consequent condition, because it followeth our Right to, and Possession of the benefit, which Faith goeth before: But indeed it is an Antecedent Condition of its own proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent (as all Conditions are); that is, of the continuance of that Right. And I express the same thing in other terms, <hi>viz.</hi> One is the Condition of our being first Justified and having Right to Life: the other of the continuance or not losing it.</p>
                  <p>2. Note that <hi>Chamier</hi> having plainly laid down the truth, for fear of seeming to countenance the Doctrine of the Saints Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, applyeth it to the seeming Right of the commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led▪ But that Caution was needless, seeing the Law may threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the justified themselves, that if they draw back, God will have no pleasure in them; and yet God may decree to preserve them from drawing back, yea by means of such threatnings to preserve them▪</p>

Whereas St. <hi>Iames</hi> takes the same word for the approving a man in a benign and fatherly judgement, as he is considered in the quality of Gods child, and living in the Covenant of grace, as having the two <hi>essential parts of that Covenant</hi> joyned together: Faith to receive Gods grace, and Christs benefits, and works to yield him the duties of service and acknowledgment. And this justification is not opposite to the condemnation of a <hi>sinner in general,</hi> but to the particular one of an hypocrite, who rending asunder these two inseparable parts, sheweth that he hath neither one nor the other.</p>

                  <p>If any say, that all this mentions not Justification▪ I answ.

But the main thing that I intend, is, that all this being at least conditions of our salvation, they must needs be conditions of our Justification at Iudgement. For I have yet met with no man, that by a denyal would put me to prove, that whatsoever is the condition of salvation on our parts, is also the Condition of that final sentential Absolution.</p>

[that I may prevent all such evasions of the contrary minded, I thus propound my Argument. Besides the sanctity or Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, there is required of us our selves another, truly and really in our own proper persons to be performed, as necessary to salvation. It is required I say, not by way of merit or satisfaction, but of gratitude and new obedience, <hi>Luke 11. 28. Ioh. 13. 17. Heb.</hi> 12. 14. But this obedience which is by us our selves to be performed as necessary to salvation, is not that perfect obedience which exactly satisfieth the Law. For then no man should obtain eternal life: therefore this obedience which is by us our selves to be performed as necessary to salvation, is that imperfect obedience, &amp;c. You'l say, a man may be saved though he perform not that obedience, &amp;c. See further.</p>
                  <p>Page 24, 25. [3. We must hold, that the Covenant of Grace, though it take not away the Obligation of the Law, yet it takes away the Rigor, or severity and terribleness of that obligation. For though it set before our eyes an universal perfection of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to be affected, and endeavoured to our utmost strength, yet doth it not strictly and precisely require it on the pain of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation. Indeed to a certain measure of obedience, to wit, such as by ordinary Grace is possible, it doth strictly and precisely oblige us, that is, on pain of eternal damnation, requiring that we actually have it. But to a farther measure, which by the power of ordinary grace we cannot attain, it obligeth us less strictly, to wit, requiring that we have it in desire and endeavour, v. g. to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of parts, as they call it, it obligeth precisely: For it doth no otherwise promise eternal life, but on this <hi>Condition,</hi> that we actually have this.</p>

(<hi>mihi</hi>)<note place="margin">Musculus.</note> 614, 615, 616. having shewed that Christ dyed for all, and is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, which he expounds of all mankind, that are or shall be in the world from first to last; he next shews [By what means pardon of sin is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Answ.</hi> Remission is wholly free, and not due to our merits, but of meer undeserved Grace: Yet equity it self requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that it be not conferred or received but by certain means and Conditions. Of the Means I will speak in this Article; of the Conditions in the next. As of Iustification, so of Remission there is a twofold means to be acknowledged: One <hi>In which;</hi> the other <hi>By which</hi> it is conferred and received. The means <hi>In which,</hi> is Christ, &amp;c. The means <hi>By which</hi> is double: One is <hi>by which</hi> Remission is <hi>Given▪</hi> the other <hi>by which</hi> it is Accepted. The means of conferring, the Schoolmen call Applicatory; Unless the Merit of Christ, say they, be applyed to this or that man, no sin is blotted out; seeing it is blotted out only by the vertue of Christs Merit: Therefore seeing the Sacraments are the immediate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers of Christs Passion to us, he that will have any sin pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must have it by some Sacrament, in Act or in Desire.—But we say simply, that the means of conferring it, is the word of Grace, by which Remission is preached, whether generally and publikely, or specially and privately.—The means of Taking it, is not only whereby we are made capable of this Grace, but whereby we Take it, when its offered. A contrite and humble heart is capable of it: but it is one thing to be Capable, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Take it.—But when we Give this to Faith, that it Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Remission of sins, we do not exclude confession of sin, and Prayer: As good fruits are not excluded, when the Goodness of the Tree is commended: nor breathing and voice excluded, when we extol the force of eloquence. When therefore we read 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins: we must not understand it of a Confession which comes not from a belief of the word, by which we are reproved and convinced of sin. And when we pray, Forgive us our debts, I suppose it is manifest that we pray by the Spirit of Faith;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:118986:237"/> therefore all this is rightly ascribed to Faith, which by it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the receiving the grace of Reconciliation.]</p>
                  <p>4. On what Conditions are sins pardoned? In Christ as our only Propitiator, Mediator and Reconciler is the Remission of sin offered us by the word of the Gospel, and the gift of grace and mercy of God is Accepted by Faith. Yet are there certain Conditions without which this grace either is not <hi>Attained,</hi> or being <hi>Attained</hi> is not <hi>Retained.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. The first is true and constant Repentance—So Christ saith, <hi>Go, and sin no more:</hi> So saying, he signifyeth that it is in vain forgiven, which after forgiveness is again committed; To what purpose is a disease cured, which being cured, is willfully revoked? As therefore Remission of sin is not obtained without true Repentance. so being obtained, without the constant custody of this, it is not retained. 2. The second Condition is that we be reconciled to our Brethren, against whom we have sinned; and either satisfie them, if it may be done, or else petition them to forgive us. He that hath unjustly taken away that which is his brothers, doth in vain hope to be forgiven of God, unless he restore that which is ill gotten, if he can restore it. Whence is that saying, Sin is not pardoned, till that which was taken away be restored. He knew this that said, If I have defrauded any man, I restore it fourfold.—3. The third is that we our selves imitating the clemency of our heavenly Father, do forgive our debtors.—These are Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, necessary to the obtaining and Retaining Remission of sins; But yet there is no reason we should ascribe to them any Merit of our righteousnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and detract from the grace of God. For we cannot <hi>satisfie</hi> the just judgement of God, either by Repenting, or by Reconciling our brother, or by pardoning his faults.</p>

Whereas (man being fallen into a state of Condemnation by reason of sin, thereby breaking the Covenant of works) it pleased God to ordain a new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, establishing it in his only s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This offer of Christ and the receiving him by faith may clearly be expressed by an offer of peace and favour, made by a King unto a woman that is a rebellious Subject, by making offer of a marriage between her and his only Son, the heir apparent to the Crown, who to make way to this match undertakes by his fathers appointment to make full satisfaction to his fathers Justice in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and to make her every way fit to be a daughter to a King.

The application is easie throughout.

Again, no man denyes but Faith inherent in order of nature goes before Iustification in that sense we take it, yet Iustifying Faith necessarily includes such Works in it as <hi>Iames</hi> requires, at least a preparation or immediate promptness of mind to do them; and more then so was not in the work of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he commends &amp;c.] Pag. 210.

He that is just, let him be justified still, &amp;c.</hi> Answ. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks here of free Justification, that is, Remission of sin; and he will have that to be <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>continually</hi> done in this life: For though Remission of sin be fully and perfectly done as oft as it is done; yet because sin dwelling in our flesh, doth daily incite us to offend, we have <hi>every day need of Iustification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin.</hi> Whence it is that the holyest men have need ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs prescript, every day, yea every hour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to beg Remission of sins. As therefore they whose sins are forgiven, do daily pray, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses;</hi> so he that is Justified, is Justified still (or further justified): The sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this place is, [He that is freely justified by Faith in Christ, let him be yet (or further) justified, in avoiding sins, by constant maintaining (or keeping) that Iustification which he hath once attained: Or if he sin, (as the holyest often sin) by seeking again the pardon and Remission of sins.]</p>
                  <p>Here he asserteth 1. A need of daily Iustification from the guilt of daily sins. 2. That we keep and continue our Iustification, 1. By avoiding sin, that is▪ by Obedience. 2. By begging pardon when we do sin: and thus he that is justified must be justified still (Though others think the text <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. speaks of Inherent Righteousness.)</p>
                  <p>Pag. 907. Good Works are not excluded from Iustification, so as not to be present or to follow when men are justified: but <hi>Only</hi> from the cause of Iustification, that is, There is excluded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the opinion of Merit, or the Condition of the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Works, but not the Necessity and Duty of doing well.—</p>

                  <p>Pag. 914. It may be understood of the Inchoate Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Faithful, to wit, that Righteousness in us doth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, but only Inchoately; and that Love is our Righteousness, but Inchoately.—</p>

               <hi>K.</hi> which so seldom have the hap to be acquainted with the Truth, and who professeth himself that he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand me: (whether it be long of me or himself, I determine not▪) To these I shall now adde only these few words.</p>
            <p>The everlasting Enjoyment of God in Glory by perfected Man, is the Felicity which all should desire and seek. This is propounded to us by God in his Word, and the necessary means thereto prescribed; Even Jesus Christ, and Faith in him, and Obedience to him, and to God in and by him. The distempered sensual Appetite, and depraved Will of man, do incline to Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour sensual Delights. God hath resolved that these shall not be their felicity; and that they shall never be happy in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, except they take him for their Chief Good, and so farre forsake Inferiour Good, which would draw the heart from him: and except also they Give up themselves to his Sonne Jesus Christ, and to his Spirit, to be Recovered unto Him. Though all men by Nature desire to be Happy, yet all do not Desire God as their Happiness: Nor do the Regenerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves yet perfectly Desire him, or perfectly forsake that Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Good, which was their supposed Happiness▪ before they were Renewed. The Understanding is commonly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have three kinde of acts: 1. A simple apprehension of the meer Entity of a thing, or of a simple term. 2. Judgement: or the Conception of a Complex term. 3. Discourse. The first alone moves not the Will, because it concludes not of the Goodness or Evil of the thing Apprehended. The second (Judgement) is either about the End or the Means: and either Absolute, or Comparative. Several things are commonly called, Mans End (how properly I now enquire not) 1. Felicity in General. 2. Himself, the subject, commonly called the <hi>Finis cui.</hi> 3. The Natural and Moral perfection of his Person. 4. The Act of fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition, or perfect Complacency in the Blessed object, upon a full Vision: commonly called, our formal felicity. 5. The Object it self (that is, the Blessed God) commonly called our obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb facs="tcp:118986:262"/> Felicity, and our <hi>finis qui</hi> or <hi>cujus</hi> whether fitly, we shall better know hereafter.) The two first Nature hath tied us to: But not so the Object, nor to the Perfection of the Soul in a spiritual sutableness thereto. The first Absolute Judgment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in the Will, a simple Complacency or Displacency: this is the first motion of the Will. The Comparative Judgement where it is necessary, produceth Intention and Election, or else Refusal, and resolves the fluctuating Will. Where there is but one Good propounded, (either one Objective End, or One Means of absolute necessity) or wherever there's <hi>omnimoda Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Boni,</hi> nothing but Good apparent in the object, there is no work for Consultation, or the Comparative act of Judgement, and Consequently for Election: but the Absolute Judgement would proceed to be Practical, and carry out the Will to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and prosecution: Were not mans soul blinded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, there should be no Deliberation about his End, and so no Choosing of God as our End: but an Absolute Intending him, as having no Competitor: and it cannot be without great sin, for the Judgement to make any Question or Comparison, and so to Deliberate, Whether God or the Creature be our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity? and, Whether God or our Carnal selves should be our End? But seeing our depraved Judgement and Will, and Vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Senses, and the Tempters setting the Creature in Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, do necessitate a Comparative Judgement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, even about our End it self, therefore there is a kinde of Election of God as before the Creature, or a Consent or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution so to prefer him, that is necessary, before or with a right Intention and Prosecution of that End: Besides the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Due Means, that is, Necessary, seeing Satan and our flesh are so ready to propound wrong means, in Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Means of Gods prescribing. All this being so, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde, That the same Will that hath a Complacency in a thing as Judged simply Good, may yet Reject and Nill it, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to Seek or Receive it, if it be Judged either a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sser Good inconsistent with a Greater, or any way to have more Evil in it then Good: And as the Understanding doth at once apprehend it as Good Absolutely, or in some Respect, and Evil in other respects, and Comparatively a Less Good; so doth the Will at once continue to Love or Will it so farre as it is Apprehended as
<pb facs="tcp:118986:263"/> Good, and to Nill and Reject it as Inconsistent with a Greater Good, or a hinderer of it. But if it fall out that the Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of these is not discerned or believed, or but Imperfectly, then may the Will by a Practical Volition Will them both.</p>
            <p>To apply this: The Understanding of the unregenerate may know that God is Good, and Good to them, and that in very many and weighty respects he is desirable. They may know that worldly things will shortly leave them▪ and then if they have not Gods favour they shall perish: but if they have, they shall attain both perfection of body (which they may desire) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of minde, (which they desire in general, and may submit to in the particular way of Holiness, as more tolerable then Hell) besides some imperfect ineffectual knowledge of a beauty, and desirableness in Holiness it self, accompanied with an answerable motion of the Will: But every unrenewed man, hath more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Apprehensions of the Goodness of the Creature (partly by unmastered sense, and partly by perverted reason) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apprehendeth God as Evil to him, so far as he would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his enjoyment thereof, or would punish him for sinfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it: So that 1. his highest Practical estimation is of the Creature, yet not without some esteem of God: 2. And his prevailing Will is to the Creature, but not without some Will to God. And ordinarily such men are so fully convinced of the Impossibility of enjoying the Creature for ever, and being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py any other way then in God▪ that, though they could wish an everlasting fulness of the Creature, yet (seeing none but fools do Intend an End which they know Impossible to be attained) they do therefore compound a felicity in their own fancies, of the world for a time, and Heaven for Everlasting: One part standing in the enjoyment of the delights of the flesh while they live here; and the other in the deliverance from Hell, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness in Heaven hereafter: hoping that these are not inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent, but they may have heaven when they can enjoy the world no longer: because they see that many Saints Possess abundance of earthly blessings, and persecution is not now so common as it hath been, therefore they suppose they may possess the like: upon which expectation they Enjoy what the Godly do but use, and so give it the preheminence in their hearts: Or if they be convinced of the Inconsistency of a Carnal minde (in a prevalent
<pb facs="tcp:118986:263"/> degree) with an Interest in the Happiness in the Life to come, they will either perswade themselves that they are not carnally minded when they are, or one way or other will under-prop their hopes of Enjoying both: But still their fleshly minde is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and therefore they will cast their Salvation upon the adventure of such hopes, as have nothing but their own delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to support them.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Regenerate, being here Imperfect in all their Graces, are Imperfectly taken off those Carnal Ends which they Intended in their unsanctified state, and Imperfectly Inclined to God as their End: so are they also both in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and choosing the sittest Means, even Christ himself, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him. So that the best are Carnally minded in some Degree, but not in a prevalent Degree, for then they should die: The flesh and world have still some Interest in the Saints, but not the strongest: as God and the Redeemer may have some Interest, though not the chiefest, in the practical Judgement and Will of the unsanctified. Whether you will say, That the same man hath two distinct inconsistent Ends, one as Regenerate, the other so farre as he is still Carnal; Or whether you will give the name of an <hi>End,</hi> only to that Good which hath the greatest Interest in him, I will not contend about a word: If that only be called our End which is prevalently Intended in the main course of our lives, then it is God only that is our End: But if that may be called a mans End, which is Intended in his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and deviations, then the Creatures may be called ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> end, so far as we are still Carnal: For it is not only as a wrong chosen Means to our Right End, that we sinfully adhere to the Creature; but it is more as it stands in competition with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Right End, and as we Will and Love our flesh pleasing <hi>for it self.</hi> Its true, the sensual Appetite may desire it <hi>for it self,</hi> because it belongs▪ not to it to carry us higher, and to Intend an End. But the Rational Powers must subordinate both Creatures, and our natural delight in them to God. And I do not think that it is by a meer brutish Irrational motion that the godly adhere too much to the creature.</p>
            <p>I did therfore deliver my thoughts on this point, thus. That as the Act is denominated from the Object, and specified by it, so the Grace that is saving most (as to the Acts) consist not only in the Absolute but Comparative Judgment, and in that Choice or
<pb facs="tcp:118986:264"/> Comparative Willing that follows thereupon: And though there be 40 intricate Philosophical Controversies about mans Willing the End and Means, which stand in their way that would make the most exact discussion of this point, yet every Christian may safely go on these Grounds, and Conclude, That when Christs Interest is predominant or greatest in the soul, there is saving Grace; but where it is not, there is none, though yet he may have some Interest there. Here is a double preheminence that Christ must have, or a double prevalency of Grace, that it may be saving: 1. The Object must be Preferred before that which stands in Competition with it. 2. The Act must be prevalent in Degree against its Contrary, so far as that the heart and life may be denominated from it. 1. The Absolute act of the Judgment makes no Comparison: Therefore in that only the later must be lookt after. Assent to Gods word upon his Authority, must be Prevalent against our Dissent: and that will appear in our seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obeying it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. In the Comparative act of the Judgment there must be both: God must be Valued and Esteemed above all Creatures: And our Esteem must be Prevalent against our slighting and disesteem of him. 3. The main point of Tryal is in the Will: And there must be both these prevalencies before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. God must be Willed as better than all Creatures: and our Willing of him must be in a prevalent Degree against our Nilling or Unwilling. For there is in the best on earth some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Aversness to God, which may be called a Hating of him, so far as they are Carnal: though they are not therefore fitly to be called Haters of God, but Lovers of him; because they must be denominated from the Prevalent Part. The like may be said of all the Affections, so far as they are of the Rational part: for of the sensitive Passions, there is not so sure a Judgement to be made, as I expressed <hi>pag.</hi> 213. and in my <hi>Method for Peace of Conscience.</hi> In the Choice of Means all this is as clear, if not much more. Christ must be preferred before all Competitors, and all rejected for him: and our Willingness must be in a Degree that is prevalent against our Unwillingness, and our Faith as preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent against Unbelief, and our Subjection must prevail against our Rebellion, and our Obedience against our Disobedience in the course of our lives. He must have the main bent of our hearts and endeavours, though in a particular act the flesh may prevail.
<pb facs="tcp:118986:264"/> This is it that I have asserted: and with a Consent to this I am satisfied. As for the point of specification of our Acts, I never look to see the Schools agreed about it, how confidently soever M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K.</hi> talks, as if they all Conspired with him, Call the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Gradual or Specifical, as you please, so we agree in the sense, I am content. I chose to call it a Moral Specifical difference, and in that sense do maintain; That the faith of the best of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified is not specifically the same with that of the sanctified, and so of Love and other Graces. As to that Saving faith, all other is but Analogically called faith, as I have shewed in the § before-cited against M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Blake.</hi> But yet I am not of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K</hi>'<seg rend="sup">s</seg> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Natural Specification of Acts, for all his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I yet think that Acts are Naturally (and not only Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) specified from their Objects, considered Physically: and are <hi>Morally</hi> specified by those Objects as Related to the Laws that command, forbid, threaten, promise; and so by the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: (which D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Twiss</hi> will needs say, are no <hi>species</hi> of Acts, though vulgarly so called. <hi>Vind. Grat. l. 2. par. 2. Digres. 9. p.</hi> 410.)</p>
            <p>I now desire no more of the Reader then to Consent; 1. To the express words of Scripture, which I cited in that <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. §. 15. which I desire him to review: 2. And to that which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K.</hi> and I are agreed in. I hope you will take this for a reasonable motion, it being unlike that the <hi>Cretian</hi> pen of so bold a man, so self-conceited and superciliously scornful, should grant me much more then he needs must. Let us examine his Concessions, for Matter and Words. 1. For sense, he confesseth <hi>pag.</hi> 137. thus [<hi>I am of M</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">r</seg> Baxters <hi>minde, that no sober Divine will tell us, that if we love God never so little without dissembling, yet he will Accept it, though we love our lusts before him</hi>] So oft he yeeldeth that all sincere Love to God, doth prefer him before all other. Where then is our difference? Why, he thinks that no▪ others, Believe or Love God at all, but those that Love him above all. I did affirm, That as to that same Moral <hi>Species</hi> of Faith and Love, they do not at all Believe and Love God: but as to another <hi>Species</hi> they do, and truly do it. How oft doth Scripture say of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified, that they Believed in Christ, at least, for a time? But I shall leave it till I speak to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>K.</hi> himself, to prove that men unrenewed may have Faith and Love to Christ, though not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. And whereas our Doctor according to the complexion
<pb facs="tcp:118986:265"/> of his Conscience, doth prefer me to succed <hi>Pelagius</hi> in his Chair, for affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ming, that Carnal men (by the greatest help of common Grace, as I opened my meaning) may have weak Inclinations to Spiritual and Superiour Good, while he hath stronger to Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: I would have him review his Sobriety, in making all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Churches of Christ, since the Apostles daies, so far as I am able to discern by my small Reading, or by Reports, to be <hi>Pelagians.</hi> I never heard of any that thought so basely of the highest measure of that Grace which is not proper to the Saints, as this man doth. If it no whit lead▪ to God, how is it Grace? If this Doctor dare warrant his hearers, that they shall all be saved that have the least Faith, or Love, or Inclination to God; I dare not Imitate him. Except they love him above all, I dare not tell them that they are true D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sciples. Nor do I think that Nature it self is Averted from God in the highest Degree, nor all the wicked of one degree of sinfulness, nor yet as bad as they shall be in hell. Our Divines that tell us how farre Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may go, do not talk in the strain of this Doctor.</p>
            <p>Well! but how far are we yet disagreed even in terms? Why I said, that it is not a Natural, but a Moral specifick difference, and so doth he: <hi>Pag.</hi> 109. he saith [<hi>But against whom I pray do you dispute then?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I dare be bold to say, there is not one that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms a Natural or Physical difference, as you call it, between the acts of Common and Saving Grace in this your sense</hi>] And is it not pity that this Doctor that is so well agreed with me for sense and terms, should be put to the trouble of so tedious a Digression. Forsooth▪ I did unhappily express my self, because I used not his term [<hi>Appretiative</hi>] which though I neglected, I think on sufficient reason, yet to Please him, I will use it when I think on, and have no better. And so we were best part while we are Friends.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He receit of your kinde and brotherly Letter, together with those two pious, seasonable and usefull Pieces, which you were pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on me, as upon the delivery with much gladsomnes of spirit, I could not but entertain, so with no lesse thankfulnesse of heart, by these I desire to acknowledge. As for the long delay of this mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, my humble request to your self, and those other your Reverend Associated Brethren is, that it may not be mis-interpreted, as either proceeding from a wilfull neglect, or savouring of a dis-respect either of them or your self; which indeed, I confesse, might not unjustly be deemed, unlesse the reason of it were rightly conceived; but when the occasion thereof shall be truly related, I hope, it will remove all suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and surmise of failing or faultinesse on my part in either kinde; the packet wherein your Letter, with those precious
<pb facs="tcp:118986:266"/> Pieces, was included, came not to my hand (by whose default, I know not) untill the eighth of this instant; on which day it was by a messenger from <hi>London</hi> delivered to my servant at the door, and by him brought in to me sitting at dinner with some strangers; which having presently broke up, and having cast mine eye on your name at the foot of your Letter, I could not forbear to reade over, and with much cheerfulnesse so did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I rose from the board, and so laid aside, resolving by Gods permission and assista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce, to return Answer thereunto, so soon as I could have opportunity for some cursory Survey at least of either of your Pieces; which also after a little time taken for the speedy dispatch out of the way, of a Work left with me for allowance, being suddenly to passe to the Presse, I set presently upon; and having with as much expedition as I could runne over either, being so drawn on with that delight and content which I took in the subject matter of either, that I could not afford unto my self any respite, save as urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions unavoidable enforced necessary interruptions, untill I had accomplished my resolved intendment; when I began now to set pen to paper for the drawing up of an Answer, I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly damped, taking notice of the date of your Letter, which I had not formerly observed, being <hi>May</hi> 9. full two moneths ancienter then the arrival of it with me: while with my self I considered, not only, that what I should return in some regard might come altogether unseasonably, but that this long delay might be subject to mis-interpretation, as arguing a disregard and slighting of my Reverend Brethren of better esteem and repute then my self, not vouchsafing them so much as a line or two in so many weeks intervening, and a backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to enter into any good correspondence with them; a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which from my heart I have ever abhorred: howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conscious to my self of mine own weaknesses, I have never been over-forward to intrude my self into the affairs of Brethren abroad; nor have had much occasion of entercourse in this kinde, living mostly in an obscure corner, save with some few of my Brethren, with whom by occasion of alliance, or more inward conversing together formerly, I had contracted and continued familiarity and acquaintance. And thus much having premised to clear my self from any aspersion or suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:266"/> that this long delay might have occasioned, of ought in this kinde, I shall proceed unto that, which I resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>That Work of yours (to begin with it) which your self seem to have so light an esteem of, is in my account a very precious Piece, and of singular good use: For that therein that great and weighty businesse, wherein so many millions of souls are so nearly and deeply concerned, is in my poor apprehension (and I speak it sincerely, and without flattery) more fully and exactly discussed and determined, then in any that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto lighted on, that have dealt in that Subject. And indeed herein have you carried your self with exceeding great wisdom and warinesse, as by labouring to discover and distinguish the grounds and nature of this malady according to the grounds from whence it proceedeth, that the remedies may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively applied with the better hope of desired successe; so in cutting out an even way and course of cure, between the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of many godly Teachers concerning the true Nature of Faith on the one hand, whereby many weak souls have been formerly further mashed and entangled, that were more then enough puzzeld and perplexed before; and those absurd and impious conceits maintained by men of corrupt mindes or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or both, who like unskilfull or unfaithfull quacksalvers, by instilling of loose and lewd principles into the mindes of those that are seduced and deluded by them, as by palliating plaisters, and stupifying medicines, give their patients ease of their pains and aches for the present, but withall cast them into more dangerous and desperate diseases. And truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> for mine own part I have ever been of the minde that these scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losities in weak and tender hearted Christians, are as some weeds, which though weeds, and of no good use, yet argue a good soil, which a skilfull Husbandman therefore will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to deal with, or to deal for, being on good terms tendred in sale, as one unskilfull it may be would: And yet as those weeds, because but weeds, would be rid out of the way, for that they cumber the ground, and hinder the growth of things more usefull; so these needlesse scrupulosities, though oft signs of a gracious soul, of an heart desirous to approve it self unto God, carefull to please him, and fearfull to offend
<pb facs="tcp:118986:267"/> him, yet because they much distract and disturb the minde, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the soul unto that chearfull service that God requireth of his, and hinder the growth of grace, which would thrive with many much better if they were away; my course therefore hath been with such as I have found much perplexed and molested in this kinde, to perswade them, upon the groundlesnesse either of the affection it self, or the inference which through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of judgement against themselves they thence usually raise, to endeavour what they may, to lay them aside, and remove them; withall advising them to look principally unto duty, and leave the comfort of Assurance as matter of reward unto God, when he shall please to afford it; yet not neglecting the means whereby it may be attained, of which I conceive this to be a principal one, to wit, a sedulous application of themselves unto a constant performance and conscionable imployment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in those offices, which their peculiar stations and relations as well as those which the general calling of a Christian requires of them. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> what do I thus casting a dish of water into that River, unto which I may justly, and shall not fail to direct others, and whence I deem it no disparagement to draw my self? The Lord vouchsafe to blesse your labours herein, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> your self abundantly for them, as I doubt not but that many do, and will blesse him for your self and them, even then when you shall have no need of their blessings, having fully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the fruit of your labours, and being now in perfect blisse. This onely to shew that I have seriously perused it, and how I esteem of it.</p>
            <p>For the other Piece, concerning Association; which I have likewise runne over: albeit I be my self now <hi>miles emeritus,</hi> by reason of age and infirmities otherwise, utterly disabled unto my wonted employment, and do therefore in effect retain only a bare Title, to keep out some unworthy one, that were like otherwise to be obtruded, but for which I had long since wholly resigned as well the Title as the burden together with the benefit, which another enjoyeth so far as it can be attained, yea further at present then is by me received, neither hath i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> been my happinesse since that some face of a Discipline hath been setled in these parts, to be able to convene with my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren of the <hi>Classis,</hi> wherein I reside, at their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:118986:267"/> meeting places, or to enjoy their Society, save, when they have been forced for want of a full company to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down to me, that I may serve as a cifer to make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat number; yet doth it exceedingly rejoyce me at the heart, to hear of any such Combination and Agreement of the Lords faithfull servants in any part of the Land, endeavouring as with one shoulder by mutual consent to carry on the Lords work, and to settle and support the distracted and tottering estate of his Churches among us, by swarms of misleaders, and shoals of their followers, miserably torn in pieces, and almost utterly laid waste in most places: And it reviveth my spirits not a little in this present feeble and fainting condition, by ministring some matter of hope to me, notwithstanding so many plots and projects on foot to undermine and subvert his Ministry among us, that the Lord is not yet deserting of his Congregations in the middest of us, when he raiseth up the hearts of so many his faithfull and able servants, to put their hands joyntly to a work of this nature. Nor shall mine instant prayers unto him (the only service that I can do you) be wanting in your behalf, that he will be pleased, to strengthen your hands in this his work, and go along with you in the prosecution thereof, that by the gracious conduct of his powerfull Spirit, taking good effect, and finding a prosperous issue, others may be encouraged to undertake the like work, to the further restauration and better constitution of his Churches among us, the preservation of his people from those damnable Doctrines, destructive of the very power of piety that are scattered abroad in all places with us, and the strengthning of his flocks by mutual assistances against such seducers and false teachers, as would by slight or might be either creeping in among them, or breaking in upon them. There will, I doubt not, many difficulties encounter you in the carrying on of so weighty a work (for what work of worth or weighty concernment is without much difficulty accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?) as well from cunning and secret underminers, as by open and violent opposers. But the Lord All-sufficient is able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you, as with spiritual wisdom to discover and clude the wiles of the one, so with Christian courage to wrestle with, and out▪ wrestle the other, so as that neither of them may be able to prevail against you, no more then those adversaries of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:118986:268"/> people did in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes, either by their fox-like wiles, or by their Lion-like threats and forcible attempts against those despised and derided ones, that then laboured in the restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Church, and Constitution of his Service, amids those manifold obstructions, disturbances and disadvantages which in pursuance thereof they met with, as well at home as from abroad; yea whatsoever the issue of the business shall be (for the issue of no mans attempt is in his own hand) your pious endeavour (and that is all God requires of us) shall not go unregarded or unrewarded with God. But I forget whom I write to; (onely I consider, that the acclamations even of idle spectators are wont somewhat to hearten those that are wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or running in a race) and whom you intimate to have written unto, Bretheren much better able, each of them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (jointly how much more abundantly?) to afford you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advice or encouragement then my self; and who▪ in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, your Letters arriving far sooner with them then with me, have long before this given satisfaction to you in the office therein required of them.</p>
            <p>To draw towards an end; as concerning the particular Case propounded about the Administration of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper in private upon some special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: The Directory indeed doth restrain the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments unto the place of publick meeting. And I doubt not, but that the Question concerning the private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of either was seriously considered of, and sedulous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debated in the Committee whereunto that part of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was then designed, and again upon their report, if any doubt were moved about it, in the publick Assembly; where if any were, the Scribes who took the several debates there in writing, are best able to enform: For my part I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether it were questioned at all in the Assembly; nor do I remember that that part of the Directory fell to the lot of that Committee, whereof I was a Member: But for mine own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein, I concur in judgement with that learned man <hi>Sam. Maresius in Decisionibus Theologicis regimen, ordinem, praxin &amp; eutaxian spectantibus, Qu. 2. &amp;</hi> 3. to wit, that howsoever <hi>loci &amp; temporis circumstantiae non sunt de essentiâ Sacramenti,</hi> yet it is a thing most convenient, considering the nature and
<pb facs="tcp:118986:268"/> use of the Sacraments, <hi>ut in publicis conventibus administrentur,</hi> which by him appears to have been the judgement of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and is affirmed to be the constant practice of most of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches: And the contrary practice, as it may seem to favour, and be a means to nourish some Popish conceits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning either Sacrament, the reliques whereof remain still with many among us: so being in some cases admitted, it may bring in many inconveniences, one requiring the like privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as well as another, and much murmurings and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings, that it is not alike condescended to, though the cases be not alike. Yea it is apparent already, that where way hath been given thereunto, others expecting and exacting the same liberty, most Baptisms in many places are become▪ private: as also private Communions are grown very common, desired most by ignorant or Popishly affected people. For the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the children of Believers right to Baptism; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Answer not difficult: True, where it may fitly, and with due conveniency be had: nor conceive I, under submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to better judgement, that the examples of the Eunuch ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> or the Jayler by <hi>Paul,</hi> are of much force here, to infer the like usage and practice in setled and embodied Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. And for the other Sacrament▪ which is a more special badge and profession of our mutual communion with that body politick whereof we are members, it seems the rather to require a publick Convention: neither seems there to appear in Scripture any the least track or intimation of any admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of this Sacrament, save at times and in places of publick Convention.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have been bold, according to your request, to acquaint you with my thoughts herein, without prejudic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lord, <hi>Sir,</hi> vouchsafe to give a blessing unto the present business: and to support and strengthen you both in body and minde, that you may be yet further usefull unto his people, as
<pb facs="tcp:118986:269"/> by your constant courses and indefatigable endeavours hitherto you have been. That which is and shall be the hearty prayer of him; who earnestly craves of you the like Christian office at the Throne of grace in his behalf, that he may be sustained and enabled to stand upright in these faltring and deficient dayes, that the close of his frail and fainty condition, which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth near at hand, may be accompanied with inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace; and whose desire is hereby to acknowledge himself</p>

Having dispatched your Debate with him, I went on to the ensuing ones, in whom, as in the former, many passages I could not reade but with much indignation, divers not without laughter. And truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> it vexed me not a little, to think how you were fallen into the hands, not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:270"/> such as seem to have laid aside in their dealing with you, not Christianity and charity alone, but even common civility, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, humanity, and shame: and yet withall could I not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to laugh at their folly, that had no more wit and discretion, then by such manner of dealing so inconsiderately to lay open their own nakedness, and expose themselves in the issue unto contempt even with the meanest, losing much of that reputation with sober-minded men at least, that before by their parts other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes they had gained, while by such unchristian, unseemly and unsavoury carriages they seek to improve and inhance it. But you have, <hi>Sir,</hi> for the main matters in contest between you and them, besides their reproachfull and cheating courses (for they are many of them no other, no better) so put it home to them, that you have throughly and abundantly vindicated your self, cause and credit, from their false and frivolous aspersions, with all not grosly fore stalled and palpably partial; and I suppose they will have little lust (those later of them above pointed at, I mean, that yet survive) to reply ought, unless they have so brazed the fore-head, that they regard not at all, what men deem or say of them, so they may seem to say somewhat, and have the last word: Which is, I doubt, in part the disposition of that grand Champion of the <hi>Antipoedobaptistae</hi> (for an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist he will not yet be termed) who (as I am enformed) hath lately published a Work of that subject, in way of Answer to a whole half dozen of Opposites, whereof you are said to be one.</p>
            <p>For your Confession, I should have been glad to have seen it, and shall be right glad to see it, when it shall come abroad. But I heard nothing at all from your Bookseller concerning it: your Letter and Book being brought over to me by a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he made use of for the delivery of it, who having delivered it, made no stay. Nor do I suppose that it needed any perusal of mine, not likely to contain any matter of moment, that would require change: and if some phrase or form of speech should have occurred, concerning some notion, which in other terms▪ I should have deemed more fitly expressed, yet might your own expressions seem the fitter to you, as mine to me; nor would the matter in likelihood have been of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as might countervail either the delay of the Work,
<pb facs="tcp:118986:271"/> being already in part wrought off, or the damage necessarily incurred, by either the stay of the Press, or reprinting, while Letters at such distance passe <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Otherwise I should not have been nice of affording that office, though lesse needfull, to one, whom I ingenuously acknowledge to owe so much to in divers respects, and concerning mine esteem of whom I both speak and write that occasionally to others, which I will not to your self; which I am not wont to deny unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other, whom I stand lesse engaged unto, requesting of me, for what cause sometime I know not, to peruse some things, which they purpose for the Presse, or have already published, and to give my thoughts thereof; which though I finde sometime a thanklesse office, yet hath proved with other some not unusefull. From yours, <hi>Sir,</hi> I should rather have hoped to learn and gain somewhat, then to help mend or better ought.</p>
            <p>As for mine own work, though having found it a very tedious businesse, to raise any well-composed frame out of such maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confused Notes or scraps rather, as I finde them to be; yet I had begun to set upon it, and had written out some few sheets of it, when some other urgent occasions intervening, enforced to lay it aside: and to let you know the plain truth, I am now at a stand (considering the multitude of intricate que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and nice subtilties concerning this subject, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t I meet with in the writings of learned men, occasioned a great part of them by those vain and fond fancies, which these men have of late broached, and many are much taken with among us, such as I little dreamed of, when above twenty years ago I dealt in this Argument, framing my then Discourse in a practical way most, to the capacity of a plain popular Auditory, in doubt whether at all to resume it, and return to it again. Howsoever I shall not refrain briefly to acquaint you with my minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the seeming difference of those two great Apostles in this point, which I suppose will prove the same in substance with what I finde here in yours.</p>
            <p>The Case or Question in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> to me seems not the same. In <hi>Paul</hi> the Question is of sinne in general, concerning which when any man shall therewith be charged; there is no means whereby he may be justified, that is, justly assoiled from
<pb facs="tcp:118986:271"/> the otherwise just charge of being a sinner, but by <hi>his faith in Christs bloud;</hi> Christs bloud having made Satisfaction to Gods Justice for sinne; and his Faith in it, giving him a right to it, and interest in it. Whereas in <hi>James</hi> the Question is concerning some special sinne, and the questioned persons guilt of it, or freedom from it, to wit, Whether a man be a true or a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit believer, a sound and sincere, or a false and feigned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour? In which case, any person that is wrongfully so char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, may plead not guilty, and offer himself to be tried by his works, as in some cases Gods Saints have done, even with appeal to God himself: That which may be illustrated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for either case in <hi>Abraham▪ David, Job, Paul,</hi> and others. The first hint and occasion given me to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, was from a Collation that a reverend and learned Divine M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

               <hi>Johns</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> had of this Argument, when I was a young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in that House. <hi>Paul,</hi> said he, dealeth <hi>in genere didactico,</hi> by way of Instruction and Information, as the Master giving the Scholar out his lesson: the onely way for you, being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by nature, to become discharged of your sinnes, is by faith in Christs bloud. <hi>James, in genere elenctico,</hi> by way of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Triall; as the Master in hearing and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Scholar. Have you learned your lesson? Yea, then you can say it, you can construe and pearce it: if not, it is certain you have not yet learned it. So here. Have you taken out the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So he then; and either from him or some other I remember to have heard that cited as <hi>Zanchies, Fides justificat hominem, opera justificant fidem.</hi> These gave hints of that, which I afterward pitched on. But I hope this <gap reason="foreign">

Ah, how many such usefull Instruments far younger persons then my self hath the Lord of late taken away in the midst of their daies, in the prime of their strength, when they might have further have been very serviceable to his people, having much need of such in these loose and unsetled times, while I stay still, as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stake in the hedge, rather needing support then helping to support; or as his <hi>truncus ficulnus, inutile lignum,</hi>

And the term of <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> being acknowledged to be Metaphoricall, (as, if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory do not, which frequently it doth, fail me, your self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expresly say) of <hi>Trusting on</hi> or <hi>in</hi> being proper: it may seem not so fit to define, describe, or expound the proper by the tropicall, which in D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Gouges</hi> Definition of Faith I first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but could not then so well relish, and finde since in many other: Nor do I finde where the term of <hi>Regeneration</hi> is used to
<pb facs="tcp:118986:273"/> comprehend Justification, Remission and Adoption; which you seem to affirm, with <hi>L. C.</hi> p. 200. whereas on the other side M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Forbes</hi> in his of Justification, makes Adoption to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, which he makes therefore the prime benefit, and the rest to spring from it, wherein I cannot assent to him.

Nor seems B. <hi>Davenant</hi> so clear herein, making some graces concomitants of Faith, as Repentance; some consequents, as Love. Wherein also you seem to leave him, affirming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Christ to be a loving receiving of him, which cannot be without Love. As for the Instrumentality of Faith in or about the work of Justification, albeit the term commonly received and used be not proper, yet as the meaning may be, you seem not to disallow it. And surely Faith as a <hi>medium</hi> seems to have a more peculiar Office in the transaction of that main business of Justification, then either Repentance or any other grace, as the Love or Fear of God, or the like. Which to me seems the more apparent, because I finde it so oft said in the Word, that men are justified by Faith, but no where by Repentance, albeit that also be as a condition thereunto required: as also that form of speech, <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is it as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the intent of our Divines, when they use that term, to lay upon it the main stress of the great difference between us and the Papists in the Doctrine of Justification, which as it is laid down in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> (howsoever some of them that wrote before it, came in a manner home to us, and some of them that have writ since, seem now and then to condescend much to us, till they come to deliver the genuine sense of the Council)
<pb facs="tcp:118986:273"/> stands upon other terms, as <hi>Guil. Rivetus</hi> hath shewed at large in his <hi>Vindiciae Evangelicae de Justificat. Part. 3. Cap. 2, &amp;</hi> 3. But these things, <hi>Sir,</hi> I mention not to put you unto the trouble▪ of writing about them, having your hands so over-full already; but to propound them only to your consideration, as you find, or meet with occasion. Many thoughts of them, but confused ones, I have sometime in my brains, which I finde no fit terms to express, nor ability aptly to distinguish and orderly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest: Trouble enough, and more then enough, I fear, I have put you unto, in tendring to you these so many scrabbled and blurred lines, which I am scarce able sometime to reade over again my self. Nor will I imitate the <hi>Florentine</hi> Cooper, whom his soul, when he was so long about lighting a candle to see it, checks for complaining of and laying the fault on the moistness of the tinder, the bluntness of the stone, and the badness of the steel, when indeed the main defect and default was in the weakness and unsteadiness of his own hand; excusing this my scrawling by the badness of my pen, ink and paper, none yet of which I was well stored with at present, nor can I be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with, when I want, or have not at hand, but from the City; but the main reason of my such slovenly and illegible writing, and so oft blotting and interlining, is partly from my slippery memory, that forgets what I began with, ere the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be ended, and partly from mine unsteady hand, very much shaking after a few lines of any length drawn slowly out and dispatcht, and this unsteadiness, (contrary to the wont of most others) being much more troublesom to me in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in cold, and making writing therefore more tedious to me in the heat of Summer then at any other time. But it is high time for me to cease by my prating (you may well apply to me that of the Poet, not so ancient as the Name given him pretended, <hi>O solâ fortes garrulitate senes</hi>) to molest you, and withhold you from better and more usefull employments. I shall conclude all, as with a renewed acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a double engagement unto you, the one for your gift and your peculiar affection to me thereby expressed, the other for the work it self, and the business therein undertaken and transacted, so exceedingly advantagious, if not for the stopping of the mouths, (for who can charm the untamable
<pb facs="tcp:118986:274"/> tongues of such quarrelsom, licentious and shameless people?) of these broachers and abettors of these pernicious conceptions and impious notions gilded over with the specious Titles of Free Grace, and Gospel-Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like those Quacksalvers implements, of which that Ancient Writer, <hi>Tituli habent phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maca</hi> or <hi>remedia, pyxides venena,</hi> yet to discover their frauds and the dangerousness of their devices to others, and to defend and clear up the truth of God against their wicked impostures, and consequently for the staying of those that otherwise might be, and the reducing of some at least, that have been seduced by them; in which kinde I hold, as all Gods people in generall, and my self in particular, very deeply engaged unto any whom they know to have eminently laboured, as your self here have done, and to bless God for stirring them up and enabling them thereunto: So with earnest also and hearty prayer unto him, whose work it is that herein you do, that he will vouchsafe in much mercy and goodness, to second these your Pious underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings with his blessing, whereby they may become efficacious for the end by you intended in them, to support and strengthen you in your present languishing condition, against the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumnies and oppositions of your ill-minded Adversaries, and to enable you to proceed in the propugnation of his Truth and cause, so as his might may appear in your weakness.

            <p>MY Father being by an extream languishment of body disinabled to write unto you himself, hath required me to give you this account of his present condition, and of his endeavours to express his respects unto you: On <hi>July</hi> 7. he received some sheets of your Confession: the night following he was surprized with fainting fits, which afterwards turned to a Tertian Feaver: yet in the intervals he perused your Papers, wherein he met nothing of much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that required any animadversion▪ Some things of less concernment he had noted in a loose Paper, which you shall finde inclosed herein. He lies now expecting Gods season of removall of him hence, which he professes much to desire, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that his unquiet and painfull state here will be by Gods mercy exchanged for a blessed condition of rest in the Lord, before this come to you. He beseeches God to lengthen out the line of your life, inabling you to proceed in Defence of his Truth, against these novell inventions, and to the clearing of your self from these gross and false calumnies of il-minded men. Thus, <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> my Father recommends himself unto you, and I desire you to imploy your prayers for our comfort, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you that your good opinion of, and kinde respect to my Father hath engaged me to remain,</p>
